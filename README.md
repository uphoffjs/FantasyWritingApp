# Fantasy Writing App

A comprehensive worldbuilding tool for fiction writers, built with React Native and deployable as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Overview

Fantasy Writing App (evolved from Fantasy Element Builder) is a powerful tool designed to help fiction writers develop and organize the various elements of their fictional worlds. It provides structured questionnaires, relationship management, and organization tools for creating rich, consistent fictional universes.

## Current Status

- **Phase 0**: âœ… Complete - React Native Web setup with PWA support
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete - Store & Data Layer Conversion with cross-platform storage
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Partial Complete - Navigation system and basic UI components implemented
- **Phase 3**: ðŸš§ Next - Feature Implementation (Questionnaires, Elements, Relationships)
- **Phase 4-5**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - PWA deployment and native app preparation

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native 0.81.4 with TypeScript
- **Web Support**: React Native Web for PWA deployment
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 for web builds
- **PWA**: Service Worker for offline support

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project
cd FantasyWritingApp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development

### Web Development (PWA) - Primary Focus

```bash
# Start the web development server
npm run dev
# or
npm run web

# Opens at http://localhost:8080
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Create production build for web
npm run build:web

# Output will be in /dist directory
```

### Native Development (Future)

```bash
# iOS (requires Mac with Xcode)
# First install pods:
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npm run ios

# Android (requires Android Studio)
npm run android

# Start Metro bundler for native development
npm start
```

## Migration from Fantasy Element Builder

This app is a complete rewrite of the Fantasy Element Builder, converting from React web to React Native for better mobile support and future native app deployment. All existing features are being preserved and enhanced with mobile-first design.

### Data Migration
Users can export their data from the original Fantasy Element Builder and import it into this new app once the import/export feature is implemented in Phase 3.

## Development Roadmap

### âœ… Phase 0: React Native Web Setup (Complete)
- Initialized React Native project
- Added React Native Web for PWA support
- Configured webpack for web builds
- Set up PWA manifest and service worker
- Copied existing types, utils, and store logic

### ðŸš§ Phase 1: Store & Data Layer (Week 1)
- Convert Zustand store for cross-platform storage
- Implement AsyncStorage/localStorage abstraction
- Maintain all data models and business logic

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Component Conversion (Weeks 2-3)
- Convert navigation from React Router to React Navigation
- Convert UI components to React Native
- Adapt styles from Tailwind CSS to StyleSheet

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Feature Preservation (Week 4)
- Questionnaire system
- Relationship management
- Template system
- Import/Export functionality
- Search and filtering

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: PWA Deployment (Week 5)
- Production build optimization
- PWA feature enhancement
- Beta testing with ~20 users
- Performance optimization

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Native Preparation (Post-MVP)
- Configure iOS and Android projects
- Add native-specific features
- Submit to app stores

## Troubleshooting

### Web Development Issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear webpack cache if needed: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
- Check that port 8080 is available for the dev server

### Native Development Issues
- For iOS: Make sure to run `cd ios && pod install`
- For Android: Ensure Android SDK is properly configured
- See [React Native Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting)
