  1) "before all" hook for "An uncaught error was detected outside of a test":
     CypressError: Cypress detected you registered a(n) `beforeEach` hook while a test was running (possibly a hook nested inside another hook). All hooks must be registered before a test begins executing.

Move the `beforeEach` into a suite callback or the global scope.

Because this error occurred during a `before all` hook we are skipping all of the remaining tests.

Although you have test retries enabled, we do not retry tests when `before all` or `after all` hooks fail
