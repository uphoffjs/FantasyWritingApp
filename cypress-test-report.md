- Variant handling works
- Loading states functional
- Disabled state properly handled

#### TextInput Component (11/11 - 100%)
- Basic text input functional
- Multiline support working
- Error states display correctly
- Accessibility labels present

### ⚠️ Partially Passing Components

#### BaseElementForm Components
Multiple test files with varying success rates:

**BaseElementForm.incremental** (3/5 - 60%)
- ✅ Renders with questions in detailed mode
- ✅ Renders with answers
- ✅ Expands category when clicked
- ❌ Shows input values (input[type="number"] not found)
- ❌ Calls onChange when input changes

**BaseElementForm.isolated** (3/3 - 100%)
- ✅ Mounts the component
- ✅ Shows mode toggle
- ✅ Renders with simple question

**BaseElementForm.minimal** (2/2 - 100%)
- ✅ Mounts without crashing
- ✅ Renders with mock div

**BaseElementForm.simple** (2/11 - 18%)
- ✅ Renders form header and basic structure
- ✅ Handles empty questions gracefully
- ❌ Category expansion issues
- ❌ Input field selectors not found
- ❌ Select element issues (React Native Web renders as input)

**BaseElementForm.stateless** (3/10 - 30%)
- ✅ Renders without providers
- ✅ Shows categories
- ✅ Shows required field indicators
- ❌ Category interaction issues
- ❌ Input field visibility problems

#### ElementBrowser Component (15/23 - 65%)
- ✅ Element list rendering
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Sorting functionality
- ✅ Navigation handling
- ❌ Search functionality issues
- ❌ Loading state problems

### ❌ Failing Components (Module Not Found)

These components failed due to missing imports or incorrect paths:

1. **BasicQuestionsSelector.simple** - Module '../../src/components/BasicQuestionsSelector' not found
2. **Breadcrumb** - Module '../../src/components/Breadcrumb' not found, 'react-router-dom' missing
3. **CompletionHeatmap** components - Module not found
4. **Multiple other components** - Various missing module errors

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. React Native Web Compatibility
- **Issue**: Select elements render as input fields in React Native Web
- **Impact**: Tests using `cy.select()` fail
- **Example**: `BaseElementForm.simple.cy.tsx` line 293

### 2. Selector Visibility
- **Issue**: Questions and input fields not becoming visible after category expansion
- **Impact**: Most interaction tests fail
- **Root Cause**: Likely related to React Native Web rendering behavior

### 3. Missing Component Imports
- **Issue**: ~40% of test files can't find their target components
- **Impact**: Tests fail immediately with module not found errors
- **Solution Needed**: Verify component paths or create missing component stubs

### 4. Input Event Handling
- **Issue**: onChange not being called in some tests despite blur implementation
- **Impact**: Form interaction tests failing
- **Status**: Partial fix implemented, needs further investigation

## Improvements Made

### Successfully Implemented Fixes
1. ✅ Updated all selectors from `data-cy` to `data-testid` (60 files updated)
2. ✅ Added input batching with onBlur handlers in BaseElementForm
3. ✅ Fixed test file typos and incorrect type specifications
4. ✅ Implemented cy.resetFactories() command

### Pass Rate Progress
- Initial: 0% (configuration errors)
- After initial fixes: ~25%
- Current: ~30-35%

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Fix Module Import Issues**
   - Create missing component stubs in `cypress/support/component-test-helpers.tsx`
   - Verify all import paths are correct
   - Add react-router-dom to dependencies if needed

2. **Address React Native Web Rendering**
   - Investigate why categories aren't expanding to show questions
   - Fix select/input element compatibility issues
   - Ensure proper testID propagation through component hierarchy

3. **Component Visibility Issues**
   - Debug why questions aren't visible after category clicks
   - Check if animations/transitions are affecting visibility
   - Consider adding cy.wait() or checking for animation completion

### Medium Priority
4. **Input Event Handling**
   - Further investigate onChange callback issues
   - Ensure state updates are properly triggering
   - Verify event propagation in React Native Web

5. **Test Stability**
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Implement proper wait strategies for async operations
   - Consider viewport-specific test adjustments

### Low Priority
6. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Add missing test scenarios
   - Improve edge case coverage
   - Add performance benchmarks

## Test Execution Details

### Environment
```
Cypress: 14.5.4
Browser: Electron 130 (headless)
Node: v20.19.3
Platform: macOS
Dev Server: http://localhost:3003
```

### Performance Metrics
- Average test duration: 50-200ms per test
- Total execution time: ~10 minutes for full suite
- Memory usage: Stable, no leaks detected

## Conclusion

The test suite has made significant progress from the initial 0% pass rate to the current ~30-35%. The main challenges are:

1. React Native Web component rendering differences
2. Missing component modules/stubs
3. Selector visibility and interaction issues

With focused attention on the module import issues and React Native Web compatibility, the pass rate could quickly improve to 60-70%. The successfully passing components demonstrate that the test infrastructure is working correctly when components are properly configured.
