### Compilation Errors (13 specs failed to compile)
The following specs couldn't run due to module resolution errors:
- utilities/SpecialtyComponents.cy.tsx
- visualization/*.cy.tsx (multiple files)
- Several others with missing imports

## Root Cause Analysis

### 🔴 Primary Issue: Missing Factory Task Registration
**100% of test failures** are caused by:
```
CypressError: cy.task('factory:reset') failed with the following error:
The task 'factory:reset' was not handled in the setupNodeEvents method.
```

**Location**: `cypress/support/factory-helpers.ts:14`
**Impact**: Every test file calls this in the `beforeEach` hook, causing immediate failure

### 🟡 Secondary Issue: Module Resolution Errors
Multiple import path errors detected:
1. Missing components in `/src/components/`:
   - element-editor/ElementFooter
   - element-editor/ElementImages
   - element-editor/ElementRelationships
   - element-editor/ElementTags
   - LinkModal
   - SpeciesSelector components
   - Header
   - EmailVerificationBanner
   - MigrationPrompt
   - AccountMenu

2. Incorrect import paths:
   - Missing file extensions or typos in support file imports

## Fix Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure Fix (Priority: URGENT)
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

1. **Register Factory Tasks in Cypress Config**
   - Location: `/cypress.config.ts`
   - Both E2E and Component `setupNodeEvents` sections need:
   ```typescript
   on("task", {
     // Add factory tasks
     'factory:reset': () => {
       // Reset factory state
       return null;
     },
     'factory:seed': (data) => {
       // Seed factory data
       return null;
     },
     // ... existing tasks
   });
   ```

2. **Alternative: Remove Factory Dependency**
   - If factories aren't needed, update `cypress/support/factory-helpers.ts`
   - Remove the `cy.task('factory:reset')` call from beforeEach hooks
   - Replace with simpler state reset mechanism

### Phase 2: Module Resolution Fixes (Priority: HIGH)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

1. **Verify Component Existence**
   - Check if missing components actually exist in src/
   - If moved/renamed, update import paths in test files
   - If deleted, remove or skip corresponding tests

2. **Fix Import Paths**
   - Standardize relative import paths
   - Add missing file extensions where needed
   - Use path aliases if configured

3. **Component Mapping**
   ```bash
   # Quick fix script to find actual component locations
   find src -name "ElementFooter*" -o -name "LinkModal*" -o -name "Header*"
   ```

### Phase 3: Test Validation (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. **Incremental Testing**
   - Fix one category at a time
   - Start with simplest components (UI buttons, inputs)
   - Progress to complex components (forms, modals)

2. **Test Quality Review**
   - Remove duplicate/redundant tests
   - Consolidate test variants (6 TextInput test files → 1-2)
   - Update outdated test patterns

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Priority: LOW)
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

1. **Test Efficiency**
   - Reduce test isolation overhead
   - Implement shared test contexts
   - Use cy.session() for auth states

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Group related tests for parallel runs
   - Configure CI/CD for parallel execution

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Quick Win (5 minutes)
```bash
# Temporarily bypass factory reset to see other issues
sed -i '' "s/cy.task('factory:reset')/\/\/ cy.task('factory:reset')/" cypress/support/factory-helpers.ts
```

### Proper Fix (30 minutes)
1. Implement factory task handlers in cypress.config.ts
2. Fix critical import paths
3. Run single test file to validate:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run --component --spec "cypress/component/ui/Button.cy.tsx" --browser electron
   ```

## Success Metrics

After fixes are applied:
- [ ] At least 1 test file passes completely
- [ ] No compilation errors in test files
- [ ] Factory reset task executes without error
- [ ] 50%+ tests passing within each category
- [ ] Full test suite completes in < 10 minutes

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Continuing without fixing factory tasks blocks ALL testing
- **Medium Risk**: Module resolution errors prevent 20% of tests from running
- **Low Risk**: Performance issues only affect test execution speed

## Conclusion

The test suite has systematic configuration issues that prevent any tests from passing. The primary blocker is the missing factory task registration, which affects 100% of tests. Once this is resolved, the module resolution errors need addressing for approximately 20% of test files.

**Recommended Priority**:
1. Fix factory task registration (immediate)
2. Resolve module import errors (today)
3. Validate and update test patterns (this week)
4. Optimize test performance (next sprint)

With these fixes, the test suite should achieve at least 80% pass rate, assuming the underlying components are functional.
