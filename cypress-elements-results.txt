  1) ElementBrowser Component
       should handle element click navigation:
     TypeError: The following error originated from your application code, not from Cypress.

  > onElementPress is not a function

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the `uncaught:exception` event.
