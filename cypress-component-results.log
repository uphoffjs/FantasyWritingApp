  5) CreateElementModal Component
       "after each" hook for "should disable create button when no category selected":
     AssertionError: Timed out retrying after 10000ms: Expected to find element: `[data-cy], [data-testid]`, but never found it.

Because this error occurred during a `after each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `CreateElementModal Component`

  1) ElementBrowser Component
       should handle element click navigation:
     TypeError: The following error originated from your application code, not from Cypress.

  > onElementPress is not a function

When Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your application it will automatically fail the current test.

This behavior is configurable, and you can choose to turn this off by listening to the `uncaught:exception` event.
