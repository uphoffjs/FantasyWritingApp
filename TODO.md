# FantasyWritingApp - Design System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for creating a design system using both Storybook (for component documentation) and HTML mockups (for rapid design iteration).

## Phase 1: HTML Mockups Setup (Quick Wins)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Purpose**: Rapid design iteration with Live Preview

### 1.1 Structure Setup
- [x] Create `/mockups` directory at project root
- [x] Set up base HTML template with shared styles
- [x] Create CSS file mirroring React Native styles
- [x] Add responsive viewport meta tags

### 1.2 Core Page Mockups
- [x] **Login Page** (`login.html`)
  - Email/password fields
  - Social login buttons
  - "Remember me" checkbox
  - Forgot password link
  
- [ ] **Stories List** (`stories.html`)
  - Story cards with title, word count, last edited
  - Search bar
  - Sort/filter dropdowns
  - FAB for new story
  
- [ ] **Story Editor** (`story-editor.html`)
  - Rich text editor mockup
  - Chapter navigation sidebar
  - Character quick access
  - Word count display
  
- [ ] **Character Manager** (`characters.html`)
  - Character cards with avatars
  - Character detail modal
  - Relationship mapping view
  
- [ ] **Settings** (`settings.html`)
  - Theme toggle
  - Backup settings
  - Account management

### 1.3 Navigation & Index
- [x] Create `index.html` with navigation to all mockups
- [ ] Add mobile hamburger menu mockup
- [ ] Add desktop sidebar navigation

### 1.4 Styling System
- [x] Extract color palette from existing React Native styles
- [x] Create typography scale
- [x] Define spacing system (8px grid)
- [x] Add dark mode CSS variables

## Phase 2: Storybook Integration
**Timeline**: 3-4 days
**Purpose**: Component documentation and testing

### 2.1 Storybook Setup
- [ ] Install Storybook for React Native
  ```bash
  npx storybook@latest init --type react_native
  ```
- [ ] Configure for React Native Web
- [ ] Set up webpack config for web compatibility
- [ ] Add viewport addon for responsive testing

### 2.2 Component Stories
- [ ] **Atoms** (Basic Components)
  - [ ] Button component stories (all variants)
  - [ ] TextInput stories (with validation states)
  - [ ] Typography components
  - [ ] Icon stories
  
- [ ] **Molecules** (Composite Components)
  - [ ] StoryCard stories
  - [ ] CharacterCard stories
  - [ ] Navigation items
  - [ ] Form fields with labels
  
- [ ] **Organisms** (Complex Components)
  - [ ] Header/Navigation stories
  - [ ] Story list with filters
  - [ ] Editor toolbar
  - [ ] Character relationship viewer

### 2.3 Platform-Specific Stories
- [ ] Create stories showing iOS vs Android differences
- [ ] Document web-specific responsive behaviors
- [ ] Add accessibility testing stories

### 2.4 Design Tokens in Storybook
- [ ] Colors documentation page
- [ ] Typography showcase
- [ ] Spacing and layout grid
- [ ] Animation/transition specs

## Phase 3: Integration & Workflow
**Timeline**: 2 days
**Purpose**: Connect mockups and Storybook for efficient development

### 3.1 Shared Assets
- [ ] Create shared CSS that both mockups and Storybook can use
- [ ] Build script to sync styles between React Native and CSS
- [ ] Set up asset pipeline for images/icons

### 3.2 Development Workflow
- [ ] **Design Process**:
  1. Quick iteration in HTML mockups
  2. Approval from stakeholders
  3. Component creation in React Native
  4. Documentation in Storybook
  
- [ ] **Testing Process**:
  1. Visual testing in Storybook
  2. Interaction testing with Storybook
  3. Cross-platform verification
  4. Cypress E2E tests

### 3.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create README for mockups directory
- [ ] Document how to view mockups with Live Preview
- [ ] Create Storybook usage guide
- [ ] Add design system documentation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Timeline**: Optional/Ongoing
**Purpose**: Enhanced design system capabilities

### 4.1 Storybook Addons
- [ ] Add Storybook Controls for interactive props
- [ ] Install a11y addon for accessibility testing
- [ ] Add Storybook Docs for MDX documentation
- [ ] Configure Chromatic for visual regression testing

### 4.2 Design System Evolution
- [ ] Create component library package
- [ ] Build theme switching in Storybook
- [ ] Add animation documentation
- [ ] Create interaction patterns library

### 4.3 CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Auto-deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Set up visual regression tests
- [ ] Create PR preview deployments
- [ ] Add design system versioning

## Benefits Comparison

### HTML Mockups
**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero build time - instant preview
- ✅ Works with Live Preview extension immediately
- ✅ Easy for non-developers to review
- ✅ Fast iteration for layout/design

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not real components
- ❌ Manual sync with actual app
- ❌ No interactivity beyond basic HTML

### Storybook
**Pros:**
- ✅ Real React Native components
- ✅ Interactive component testing
- ✅ Auto-generated documentation
- ✅ Cross-platform testing
- ✅ Component isolation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires build/compilation
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Learning curve for team

## Recommended Approach

### Immediate (Week 1):
1. Start with HTML mockups for immediate design feedback
2. Create basic page layouts and navigation
3. Establish color palette and typography

### Short-term (Week 2-3):
1. Set up Storybook for existing components
2. Document current component library
3. Create stories for new components

### Long-term (Ongoing):
1. Use mockups for new feature design
2. Convert approved mockups to React Native components
3. Document all components in Storybook
4. Maintain as living design system

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Stakeholder approval time reduced by 50%
- [ ] Component reusability increased to 80%
- [ ] Design-to-development handoff time cut by 40%
- [ ] Cross-platform consistency issues reduced by 70%
- [ ] New developer onboarding time reduced by 30%

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Create HTML mockup structure and base template
2. **Tomorrow**: Build first 3 page mockups (login, stories list, editor)
3. **This Week**: Complete all mockups and get stakeholder feedback
4. **Next Week**: Begin Storybook setup and component documentation

## Notes
- HTML mockups are for design iteration, not production
- Storybook will be the source of truth for components
- Keep mockups simple - they're disposable prototypes
- Focus on mobile-first design in both approaches
- Consider using Figma for complex interactions not possible in HTML
