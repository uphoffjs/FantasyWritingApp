# FantasyWritingApp - Design System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for creating a design system using both Storybook (for component documentation) and HTML mockups (for 1:1 representation of the current app).

## Phase 1: HTML Mockups Setup (1:1 App Representation)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Purpose**: Accurate representation of current app with responsive design
**Requirements**: 
- **Must be 1:1 with current app implementation**
- **Include both mobile and desktop responsive versions**
- **Follow existing component structure and Storybook design tokens**

### 1.1 Structure Setup
- [x] Create `/mockups` directory at project root
- [x] Set up base HTML template with shared styles
- [x] Create CSS file mirroring React Native styles
- [x] Add responsive viewport meta tags
- [x] Import and use existing Storybook design tokens
- [x] Map current app components to HTML equivalents

### 1.2 Core Page Mockups (1:1 with Current App)
**Note**: Each mockup must match the current app's screens exactly, with responsive breakpoints for mobile (< 768px), tablet (768px - 1024px), and desktop (> 1024px).

- [x] **Login Page** (`login.html`) - *Needs update to match current app*
  - Match current LoginScreen.web.tsx layout
  - Responsive: Mobile-first with desktop centered form
  - Use existing auth form components structure
  - Apply current color tokens and typography
  
- [x] **Project List** (`projects.html`) - *Previously "Stories List", needs renaming*
  - Match current ProjectListScreen.web.tsx
  - Responsive grid: 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3+ desktop
  - Include actual project card structure from ProjectList.tsx
  - Use VirtualizedProjectList patterns for large lists
  
- [x] **Element Editor** (`element-editor.html`) - *New, replaces Story Editor*
  - Match current ElementScreen.tsx layout
  - Include ElementHeader component structure
  - Responsive: Sidebar on desktop, drawer on mobile
  - Questionnaire system with dynamic fields
  
- [x] **Project Dashboard** (`project-dashboard.html`) - *New*
  - Match current ProjectScreen.tsx
  - Element categories grid
  - Progress tracking components
  - Responsive: Stack on mobile, grid on desktop
  
- [x] **Settings** (`settings.html`)
  - Match current SettingsScreen.tsx
  - Theme toggle with current implementation
  - Sync status components
  - Account management section

### 1.3 Navigation & Layout (Match Current App)
- [x] Create `index.html` with navigation to all mockups
- [x] Mobile navigation - match current MobileHeader.tsx
- [x] Desktop sidebar - match current navigation structure
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation - match Breadcrumb.tsx component

### 1.4 Styling System (Use Existing Design Tokens)
- [x] Extract color palette from existing React Native styles
- [x] Create typography scale
- [x] Define spacing system (8px grid)
- [x] Add dark mode CSS variables
- [x] Import design tokens from src/design-tokens/
- [x] Use tokens from style-dictionary output
- [x] Match exact colors from fantasyMasterColors.ts
- [x] Apply consistent spacing from design system

## Phase 2: Storybook Integration
**Timeline**: 3-4 days
**Purpose**: Component documentation and testing

### 2.1 Storybook Setup
- [x] Install Storybook for React Native
  ```bash
  npx storybook@latest init --type react_native
  ```
- [x] Configure for React Native Web
- [x] Set up webpack config for web compatibility
- [x] Add viewport addon for responsive testing


### 2.3 Platform-Specific Stories
- [x] Create stories showing iOS vs Android differences
- [x] Document web-specific responsive behaviors
- [x] Add accessibility testing stories

### 2.4 Design Tokens in Storybook
- [x] Colors documentation page
- [x] Typography showcase
- [x] Spacing and layout grid
- [x] Animation/transition specs

## Phase 3: Integration & Workflow
**Timeline**: 2 days
**Purpose**: Connect mockups and Storybook for efficient development

### 3.1 Shared Assets
- [x] Create shared CSS that both mockups and Storybook can use
- [x] Build script to sync styles between React Native and CSS
- [x] Set up asset pipeline for images/icons

### 3.2 Development Workflow
- [x] **Design Process**:
  1. Quick iteration in HTML mockups
  2. Approval from stakeholders
  3. Component creation in React Native
  4. Documentation in Storybook
  
- [x] **Testing Process**:
  1. Visual testing in Storybook
  2. Interaction testing with Storybook
  3. Cross-platform verification
  4. Cypress E2E tests

### 3.3 Documentation
- [x] Create README for mockups directory
- [x] Document how to view mockups with Live Preview
- [x] Create Storybook usage guide
- [x] Add design system documentation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Timeline**: Optional/Ongoing
**Purpose**: Enhanced design system capabilities

### 4.1 Storybook Addons
- [x] Add Storybook Controls for interactive props
- [x] Install a11y addon for accessibility testing
- [x] Add Storybook Docs for MDX documentation

### 4.2 Design System Evolution
- [ ] Create component library package
- [ ] Build theme switching in Storybook
- [ ] Add animation documentation
- [ ] Create interaction patterns library


## Benefits Comparison

### HTML Mockups (1:1 App Representation)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero build time - instant preview
- ✅ Works with Live Preview extension immediately
- ✅ Easy for non-developers to review
- ✅ Accurate representation of current app state
- ✅ Responsive testing without device/emulator
- ✅ Quick validation of design tokens

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not real components (but mirrors them exactly)
- ❌ Requires manual sync when app changes
- ❌ Limited interactivity (HTML/CSS only)

### Storybook
**Pros:**
- ✅ Real React Native components
- ✅ Interactive component testing
- ✅ Auto-generated documentation
- ✅ Cross-platform testing
- ✅ Component isolation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires build/compilation
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Learning curve for team

## Recommended Approach (1:1 Implementation)

### Immediate (Week 1):
1. Create HTML mockups that exactly match current app screens
2. Ensure responsive breakpoints match app behavior
3. Use existing design tokens and component structure
4. Validate against running app at localhost:3002

### Short-term (Week 2-3):
1. Set up Storybook for existing components
2. Document current component library with stories
3. Ensure Storybook tokens match mockup CSS

### Long-term (Ongoing):
1. Keep mockups synchronized with app changes
2. Use mockups for responsive design validation
3. Document all components in Storybook
4. Maintain as accurate representation of current state

## Component Mapping Guide (HTML to React Native)

### Core Components to Replicate
```
HTML Element                 → React Native Component
----------------------------------------------------------
.project-card               → ProjectList.tsx card structure
.element-header             → ElementHeader.tsx layout
.breadcrumb                 → Breadcrumb.tsx navigation
.mobile-header              → MobileHeader.tsx structure
.virtualized-list           → VirtualizedProjectList patterns
.relationship-modal         → RelationshipModal.tsx layout
.search-results             → SearchResults.tsx structure
.completion-heatmap         → CompletionHeatmap.tsx visual
```

### Responsive Breakpoints (Must Match)
```css
/* Mobile First - Default */
@media (min-width: 768px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (min-width: 1024px) { /* Desktop */ }
@media (min-width: 1440px) { /* Large Desktop */ }
```

### Design Token Usage
```css
/* Import from generated tokens */
@import '../src/design-tokens/tokens.css';

/* Use exact color values from */
/* src/constants/fantasyMasterColors.ts */
/* src/constants/fantasyTomeColors.ts */
```

## Notes
- HTML mockups must be 1:1 representation of current app
- Use actual component structure and naming from React Native code
- Apply exact design tokens from Storybook/style-dictionary
- Test responsive behavior matches app at all breakpoints
- Validate against running app at localhost:3002
