## 📝 Notes

### Key Decisions Made
- **No Cypress component testing** - Architecture mismatch with React Native
- **Jest + RNTL for components** - Industry standard for RN
- **Cypress for web E2E only** - Best tool for browser testing
- **Detox for native E2E** - When native testing needed

  - React Navigation mocks for navigation testing
  - Platform and Dimensions mocks for cross-platform testing
  - Gesture handler, Reanimated, Safe Area mocks
- Fixed nativewind/PostCSS conflict by updating babel.config.js for test environment
- Created test utilities in `src/test/testUtils.tsx` with:
  - `renderWithProviders` helper
  - `renderWithNavigation` helper
  - Mock data factories
  - Platform utilities
- Verified setup with passing Button component test
- Added test scripts to package.json for unit, watch, coverage, and debug modes

**Technical Challenges Resolved:**
1. **NativeWind PostCSS Issue**: Resolved by excluding nativewind/babel plugin in test environment
2. **Platform/Dimensions Mocking**: Fixed host component detection for React Native Testing Library
3. **Jest Configuration**: Updated from deprecated "timers" to "fakeTimers" configuration

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 2: Component Test Migration
- Migrate existing Cypress component tests to Jest + RNTL
- Create comprehensive component test suite
