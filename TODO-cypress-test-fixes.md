### Session 5 Fixes Applied (Latest):
1. **TypeScript Syntax Errors Fixed**: Fixed 9 test files with syntax errors
   - ErrorBoundary.cy.tsx - Fixed arrow function syntax
   - ElementForms.cy.tsx - Fixed forEach arrow function
   - CreateProjectModal.cy.tsx - Fixed chained method calls
   - ImageUpload.cy.tsx - Fixed chained method syntax
   - MarkdownExportModal.cy.tsx - Fixed object property access
   - Toast.cy.tsx - Fixed missing closing braces
   - TemplateComponents.cy.tsx - Fixed missing closing brace
   - VirtualizedList.cy.tsx - Fixed function declaration syntax
2. **Import/Export Mismatches Resolved**:

   - Fixed PerformanceMonitor component imports
   - Fixed AuthGuard default import issues
3. **Missing Services Created**:
   - Created errorLogging service with comprehensive error tracking
   - Created RelationshipOptimizationService for relationship analysis
   - Fixed store import paths in cypress session commands

### Session 4 Fixes Applied:
1. **afterEach hook systematic failure fixed**: Created fix-afterEach-hooks.js script that updated 70 test files
   - Issue: cy.captureFailureDebug() was being called unconditionally
   - Solution: Added `if (this.currentTest.state === 'failed')` condition check
2. **cy.stub() not defined fixed**: Installed sinon and added stub/spy commands
   - Installed: sinon@19.0.2 and @types/sinon
   - Created: /cypress/support/commands/utility.ts with stub support
3. **Debug command imports fixed**: Fixed circular import issues
   - Updated commands.ts to import './commands/index'
   - Fixed utility imports to properly load all command modules
4. **Running full test suite**: All 71 component test specs now executing

### Session 3 Fixes Applied:
1. **Debug commands fixed**: Added 'log' task to component config in cypress.config.ts
2. **Debug commands verified**: Commands exist in /cypress/support/commands/debug.ts and are properly imported
3. **Tests running**: All component tests can now execute with debug commands working

### Session 2 Fixes Applied:
1. **Browser solution**: Electron browser works where Chrome failed
2. **Factory tasks**: Added factory:reset, factory:create, factory:scenario to cypress.config.ts
3. **Tests executing**: Tests now run and we can see actual failures
4. **Next issue identified**: Missing debug commands (cy.comprehensiveDebug, cy.captureFailureDebug)

### Key Fixes from Session 1:
1. **commands.ts**: Changed to import './commands' index file instead of individual missing files
2. **session.ts**: Fixed component-wrapper import path from '../component-wrapper' to '../../component-wrapper'
3. **Store verification**: Confirmed rootStore.ts and authStore.ts exist with correct exports

## 🚨 P0 - CRITICAL (Must fix immediately to unblock tests) ✅ COMPLETED

### Fix Webpack Compilation Errors

#### Missing Command Module Imports
- [x] Open `/cypress/support/commands.ts`
- [x] ~~Comment out or remove the following imports:~~
  - [x] ~~`import './commands/story';`~~
  - [x] ~~`import './commands/character';`~~
  - [x] ~~`import './commands/setup';`~~
- [x] **FIXED**: Changed to import './commands' index file which properly organizes all command imports

#### Missing Store Dependencies
- [x] Open `/cypress/support/commands/auth/session.ts`
- [x] Fix store imports:
  - [x] Check if `rootStore` exists in `/src/store/` directory ✅ EXISTS
  - [x] Check if `authStore` exists in `/src/store/` directory ✅ EXISTS
  - [x] ~~Update import paths to match actual store locations:~~ (Stores are correctly imported in component-wrapper.tsx)
- [x] Fix component-wrapper import:
  - [x] Check if `component-wrapper` exists in `/cypress/support/` ✅ EXISTS (component-wrapper.tsx)
  - [x] **FIXED**: Updated import path from '../component-wrapper' to '../../component-wrapper'

### Verify Store Structure
- [x] List all files in `/src/store/` directory ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Document actual store names and structure:
  - authStore.ts (exports useAuthStore)
  - rootStore.ts (exports useWorldbuildingStore)
  - worldbuildingStore.ts, toastStore.ts, notificationStore.ts, memoryStore.ts
- [x] Map test expectations to actual store implementation:
  - [x] Expected: `rootStore` → Actual: ✅ EXISTS (exports useWorldbuildingStore)
  - [x] Expected: `authStore` → Actual: ✅ EXISTS (exports useAuthStore)
- [x] ~~Update all test files referencing stores~~ (No changes needed - stores correctly referenced)

## 🔴 P1 - HIGH (Fix after unblocking compilation)

### Test Execution Validation
- [x] Run `npm run test:component` to verify compilation fixes ✅ WEBPACK COMPILES SUCCESSFULLY!
- [x] Document any new errors that appear after fixing imports ✅ Only warnings (cypress-axe), no errors
- [x] Verify Chrome browser launches successfully ✅ Chrome 118 headless launched
- [x] Confirm webpack dev server starts on port 3003 ✅ Running on port 3003

### Generate Test Coverage
- [ ] Run tests with coverage: `npm run test:component -- --coverage`
- [ ] Document coverage percentages:
  - [ ] Statements: ____%
  - [ ] Branches: ____%
  - [ ] Functions: ____%
  - [ ] Lines: ____%
- [ ] Identify components with low coverage
- [ ] Create coverage improvement plan

### Fix Actual Test Failures
- [x] Run tests and capture failure output ✅ Tests now running with Electron!
- [x] Categorize failures by type:
  - [x] ~~Component rendering issues~~ (Not the issue)
  - [x] ~~Selector problems~~ (Not the issue)
  - [x] ~~Async timing issues~~ (Not the issue)
  - [x] ~~State management problems~~ (Not the issue)
  - [x] **ACTUAL ISSUES FOUND**:
    - ✅ Missing custom debug commands (cy.comprehensiveDebug, cy.captureFailureDebug) - **FIXED**
    - ✅ Factory tasks were missing - **FIXED**
- [x] Create fix priority list based on impact:
  1. ✅ FIXED: Factory tasks (factory:reset, factory:create, factory:scenario)
  2. ✅ FIXED: Debug commands (added log task to cypress.config.ts)
  3. IN PROGRESS: Running full test suite to assess actual test failures
