# Session Summary - 2024-09-19

## Project Context
**FantasyWritingApp** - React Native cross-platform creative writing application
- Location: `/Users/jacobstoragepug/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp`
- Tech Stack: React Native 0.81.4, TypeScript, Zustand, Webpack, Cypress
- Platform Support: iOS, Android, Web (via React Native Web)

## Session Activities

### 1. Project Context Loading
- Loaded FantasyWritingApp project configuration
- Reviewed project structure and dependencies
- Analyzed CLAUDE.md for development guidelines
- Identified project as worldbuilding/story creation tool with "Elements" concept

### 2. Dependency Issue Resolution
**Problem**: `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-native-svg'`
- **Root Cause**: Missing `react-native-svg` package dependency
- **Impact**: ProgressRing.tsx component and 3 dependent components
- **Resolution**: Successfully installed `react-native-svg@^15.13.0`
- **Verification**: Package added to package.json line 70 and exists in node_modules/

## Key Discoveries

### Project Architecture Insights
1. **Element System**: Core concept for worldbuilding (characters, locations, magic systems, etc.)
2. **Component Structure**: Well-organized with common/native/web specific components
3. **State Management**: Uses Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
4. **Testing Setup**: Comprehensive with Cypress for web E2E and component testing

### Development Standards
- Must use `data-cy`/`testID` attributes for test selectors
- Always include helpful code comments (Better Comments style)
- Mobile-first development approach
- Mandatory `npm run lint` before marking tasks complete

### Technical Decisions
- React Native SVG used for circular progress indicators
- Platform-specific code handled via Platform.OS checks
- Web version runs on port 3002 with Webpack
- Supabase integration for backend functionality

## Unresolved Issues
- Multiple syntax errors in various components (unterminated string constants)
  - Button.tsx (line 77)
  - CreateElementModal.tsx (line 322)
  - ElementBrowser.tsx (line 347)
  - ElementEditor.tsx (line 201)
  - ImportExport.tsx (line 386)
  - ImportExportWeb.tsx (line 268)
  - InstallPrompt.tsx (line 360)
  - RelationshipManager.tsx (line 408)
  - TemplateSelector.tsx (line 309)

## Session Metadata
- Duration: ~15 minutes
- Commands Executed: 1 (npm install react-native-svg)
- Files Analyzed: 4 (package.json, CLAUDE.md, ProgressRing.tsx, webpack output)
- Issues Resolved: 1 (react-native-svg dependency)
- Background Processes: 26 active development/test servers

## Next Session Recommendations
1. Address the unterminated string constant errors in multiple components
2. Verify ProgressRing component renders correctly after SVG library installation
3. Consider iOS pod installation if testing on iOS devices
4. Review and potentially clean up multiple running background processes
