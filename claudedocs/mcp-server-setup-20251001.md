# MCP Server Setup Session Summary

## Date: 2025-10-01

## Objective

Fix SuperClaude MCP servers (Serena, Playwright, others) that weren't loading in Claude Code.

## Root Cause Analysis

- SuperClaude MCP config files existed in project directory: `/Users/jacobuphoff/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp/superclaude/MCP/configs/`
- These were NOT being read by Claude Code
- Claude Code reads MCP configuration from `~/.claude.json` only
- The project configs were just reference documentation, not active configurations

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Investigation

- Located active MCP config: `~/.claude.json`
- Found working MCP servers: sequential-thinking, context7, magic, morphllm-fast-apply
- Identified missing servers: serena, playwright, tavily

### 2. Backup

- Created backup: `~/.claude.json.backup-20251001-143954`
- Original file size: 53K

### 3. Configuration Updates

Added to `~/.claude.json` mcpServers section:

**Serena:**

```json
"serena": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": [
    "--from",
    "git+https://github.com/oraios/serena",
    "serena",
    "start-mcp-server",
    "--context",
    "ide-assistant"
  ],
  "env": {}
}
```

**Playwright:**

```json
"playwright": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
  "env": {}
}
```

### 4. Verification

Current MCP servers in `~/.claude.json`:

- context7 ✅
- magic ✅
- morphllm-fast-apply ✅
- playwright ✅ (newly added)
- sequential-thinking ✅
- serena ✅ (newly added)

## Key Learnings

1. **MCP Configuration Locations:**

   - Active config: `~/.claude.json`
   - Alternative: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Project configs in `/superclaude/MCP/configs/` are reference only

2. **MCP Configuration Format:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "server-name": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "command-to-run",
         "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Activation Requirements:**
   - Changes require Claude Code restart
   - MCP servers load on startup only
   - Server status visible during startup

## Next Steps for User

1. **Restart Claude Code** - Exit and restart to load new MCP servers
2. **Verify MCP tools** - Check that Serena and Playwright tools are available
3. **Test functionality** - Try using the new MCP server tools

## Troubleshooting Reference

**If Serena fails to load:**

- Check if `uvx` is installed: `which uvx`
- Install if missing: `pip install uv` or `pipx install uv`

**If Playwright fails to load:**

- Network issue during npm package download
- Check npm connectivity: `npm ping`

**View MCP status:**

- Claude Code shows MCP server connection status at startup
- Look for error messages in startup output

## Files Modified

- `~/.claude.json` - Added serena and playwright MCP servers

## Files Created

- `~/.claude.json.backup-20251001-143954` - Backup of original config
- `/tmp/session_summary_mcp_setup.md` - This summary

## Time Investment

- Investigation: ~15 minutes (using Sequential MCP for analysis)
- Implementation: ~5 minutes
- Documentation: ~5 minutes
- Total: ~25 minutes

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Configuration updated
- ✅ Backup created
- ⏳ MCP servers activated (requires restart)
- ⏳ Tools verified working (pending restart)
