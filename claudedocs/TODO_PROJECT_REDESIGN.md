## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Critical**: Theme system, responsive layout, project dashboard
2. **High**: Element cards, writing editor, navigation
3. **Medium**: Visual polish, animations, advanced search
4. **Low**: Bonus features, gamification, collaboration

### Technical Decisions
- Use React Native's built-in components where possible
- Implement cross-platform code with minimal platform-specific branches
- Prioritize web performance since it's the primary platform
- Use Zustand for state management (already in place)
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all new components

### Design Principles
- Clean, professional UI with subtle fantasy elements
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance over visual effects
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Consistent user experience across platforms

### Testing Strategy
- Test-driven development for critical features
- Cypress for E2E testing on web
- Manual testing on iOS/Android
- Performance monitoring with Lighthouse
- User testing with actual writers
