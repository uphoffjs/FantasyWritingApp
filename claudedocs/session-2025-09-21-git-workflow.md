# Session Summary - 2025-09-21: Git Workflow & Documentation

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Focus**: Git workflow management, documentation updates, and branch operations
- **Current Branch**: `feature/element-enhancements`
- **App Status**: Running on http://localhost:3000

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Project Context Loading ✅
- Loaded FantasyWritingApp project context
- Verified app running on port 3000
- Identified multiple background webpack processes

### 2. Git Cleanup & Commits ✅
- Cleaned up all uncommitted changes from `debug/app-investigation` branch
- Added `/dist` directory to .gitignore
- Created comprehensive commit with 28 files changed:
  - 4 new web components (ElementEditor, ProgressRing, TemplateSelector, ElementScreen)
  - Multiple component improvements and theme fixes
  - Infrastructure updates and logging improvements

### 3. App Debugging Documentation ✅
- Added comprehensive "App Debugging & Error Diagnostics" section to CLAUDE.md
- Documented systematic diagnostic workflow for app failures
- Included error boundary implementation examples
- Added console error capture setup
- Created common error patterns reference table

### 4. Branch Management ✅
- Successfully merged `debug/app-investigation` into `dev` branch
- Created new feature branch `feature/element-enhancements` from dev
- Resolved merge conflicts in workflow documentation
- Cleaned up stashed changes

## Technical Discoveries

### Webpack Process Management
- Multiple webpack dev servers running on different ports
- Process ID tracking for background tasks:
  - 815ebc: Main webpack process (PORT=3000)
  - Various other processes on different ports

### React Native Web Considerations
- Theme context handling with optional provider pattern
- Fallback values for components without ThemeProvider
- testID to data-cy attribute conversion for testing

### File Changes Pattern
- Linter automatically fixing imports and formatting
- ESLint configuration updates for better React Native support
- Webpack configuration improvements for development

## Current Project State

### Branch Structure
```
* feature/element-enhancements (current)
  dev (8 commits ahead of origin)
  debug/app-investigation (merged)
  main
```

### Key Files Modified
- CLAUDE.md - Added debugging documentation
- .gitignore - Added dist directory
- Multiple component files with theme improvements
- Testing configuration updates

### Running Processes
- Web development server on port 3000
- Multiple background webpack processes
- App functioning normally

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Push dev branch to origin** - 8 commits ahead need to be pushed
2. **Continue element enhancements** - Now on clean feature branch
3. **Implement error boundaries** - Documentation added, implementation pending
4. **Clean up background processes** - Multiple webpack instances running

## Session Learnings

### Git Workflow Best Practices
- Always check status before operations
- Use TodoWrite to track multi-step workflows
- Stash local changes before branch switches
- Create descriptive merge commit messages

### Documentation Standards
- Include diagnostic workflows in CLAUDE.md
- Document both what Claude can and cannot do
- Provide clear examples for error reporting
- Use structured format for troubleshooting guides

### Development Workflow
- Keep dist directory out of version control
- Run lint before marking tasks complete
- Verify app status after major operations
- Use parallel commands for efficiency

## Recovery Information
If session needs to be restored:
1. Current directory: `/Users/jacobuphoff/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp`
2. Current branch: `feature/element-enhancements`
3. App running on: http://localhost:3000
4. No uncommitted changes (except workflow doc)
5. All tests and lint passing
