# Checkpoint: Cypress Test Fixes - Session 4
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Project**: FantasyWritingApp
**Focus**: Cypress Component Testing Framework Fixes

## Current State Summary
âœ… **All P0/P1 Critical Issues Resolved**
- 71 component test specs now executable
- Framework-level failures eliminated
- Tests running with Electron browser
- Debug and stub commands operational

## Quick Reference for Continuation

### If Tests Fail with "cy.comprehensiveDebug is not a function"
- Check: `/cypress/support/commands/debug.ts` exists
- Verify: `import './commands/index'` in commands.ts
- Ensure: `log` task defined in cypress.config.ts component section

### If Tests Fail with "cy.stub is not a function"
- Check: sinon installed (`npm ls sinon`)
- Verify: `/cypress/support/commands/utility.ts` exists
- Ensure: utility.ts imported in commands/index.ts

### If All Tests Fail in afterEach Hooks
- Run: `node /cypress/component/fix-afterEach-hooks.js`
- Pattern: `if (this.currentTest.state === 'failed')` wrapper needed

## Active Background Processes
Multiple webpack dev servers and test runners active:
- Port 3002: Main web dev server
- Port 3003: Cypress component dev server
- Process b5eb6e: Full test suite running with Electron

## Key Files to Remember
```
/TODO-cypress-test-fixes.md                     # Master progress tracker
/cypress/component/fix-afterEach-hooks.js       # Automation script
/cypress/support/commands/utility.ts            # Stub/spy support
/cypress/support/commands/debug.ts              # Debug commands
/claudedocs/session-4-cypress-fixes.md         # Detailed session notes
```

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Check test suite completion: `cat /tmp/test-report.txt | tail -50`
2. Review any actual component failures (not framework issues)
3. Generate coverage report if needed
4. Continue with P2 items from TODO file

## Critical Patterns Discovered
1. **Systematic failures = Framework issue** (not component problems)
2. **afterEach hooks must be conditional** to avoid false failures
3. **Circular imports break silently** - always use explicit paths
4. **Electron > Chrome** for Cypress component testing stability

## Dependencies Added This Session
```json
"sinon": "^19.0.2",
"@types/sinon": "^17.0.3"
```

## Session Metrics
- Issues resolved: 3 critical
- Files modified: 73
- Tests unblocked: 71 specs
- Automation created: 1 script
- Time invested: ~1 hour

## Context for Next Session
All framework-level issues resolved. Ready to:
1. Address actual component test failures
2. Improve test coverage
3. Optimize webpack configuration (P2 items)
4. Document testing best practices
