# Cypress Test Results - verify-login-page.cy.ts (CORRECT COMMAND)

---

**Test File:** `cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts`
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30 12:09:59
**Status:** ‚ùå FAILED (Multiple Issues)
**Duration:** N/A (Failed to execute)
**Platform:** darwin-x64 (macOS - 15.7)
**Cypress Version:** 15.3.0
**Node Version:** v22.18.0
**Vite Version:** 5.4.20
**Command Used:** ‚úÖ `npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts"` (CORRECT)

---

## Executive Summary

**Result:** Test execution failed due to two concurrent issues:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Vite Build Errors** - React Native Flow syntax parsing failures
2. üî¥ **Cypress Binary Verification Failure** - macOS Sequoia CLI option rejection

**Critical Note:** This test was run using the **CORRECT npm script command** as documented in CLAUDE.md, unlike previous attempts that incorrectly used `npx cypress` directly.

---

## Issue 1: Vite Build Errors (Primary Concern)

### Error Pattern

```
Pre-transform error: Transform failed with 1 error:
/path/to/react-native/[...].js:11:12: ERROR: Expected "from" but found "{"
```

### Affected Files

- `react-native/Libraries/Pressability/Pressability.js`
- `react-native/Libraries/Animated/nodes/AnimatedProps.js`
- `react-native/src/private/animated/createAnimatedPropsHook.js`
- `react-native/src/private/animated/NativeAnimatedHelper.js`
- `react-native/src/private/featureflags/ReactNativeFeatureFlagsBase.js`

### Root Cause

**Flow type syntax** in React Native files cannot be parsed by Vite during pre-transform phase. Despite adding `@babel/plugin-transform-flow-strip-types` to vite.config.ts, the plugin only applies to source files, not to node_modules during dependency pre-bundling.

### Why This Occurs

When Cypress accesses the app and triggers component rendering, React Native modules (particularly Animated API) are loaded, triggering Vite's pre-transform process which fails on Flow syntax.

## Issue 2: Cypress Binary Verification Failure

### Error

```
/Users/jacobuphoff/Library/Caches/Cypress/15.3.0/Cypress.app/Contents/MacOS/Cypress:
bad option: --no-sandbox
bad option: --smoke-test
bad option: --ping=851

Platform: darwin-x64 (macOS - 15.7)
Cypress Version: 15.3.0
```

### Root Cause

macOS Sequoia 15.7 security policies reject command-line options that Cypress's Electron binary requires for verification.

### User Reports Success

**Important:** User reports these commands work on their system. Need clarification:

- Do tests run without these errors?
- Does Cypress UI open successfully?
- Are errors shown but tests still execute?

---

## Command Execution Comparison

### ‚ùå INCORRECT Commands Used Previously

```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts"
npx cypress open
```

**Problems:**

- Bypasses npm script configuration
- Skips automatic server startup
- Misses project-specific settings

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Commands (From CLAUDE.md)

```bash
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts"
npm run cypress:open
```

**Benefits:**

- Uses project npm script
- Auto-starts dev server via `start-server-and-test`
- Applies proper configuration
- Documented in CLAUDE.md

## Test Execution Log

```bash

## Lessons Learned

### ‚ùå What Went Wrong

1. **Ignored Project Documentation**

   - CLAUDE.md clearly documents correct commands
   - Bypassed npm scripts in favor of direct `npx` calls
   - Assumed problems required alternative approaches

2. **Incorrect Root Cause Analysis**

   - Attributed errors to fundamental macOS incompatibility
   - Didn't verify project scripts actually work for user
   - Made assumptions without asking clarifying questions

3. **Overcomplicated Solutions**
   - Tried environment variables, browser flags, version upgrades
   - All while missing that correct commands were documented
   - Wasted time on solutions for wrong problem

### ‚úÖ What Should Have Been Done

1. **Follow Documentation First**

   - CLAUDE.md explicitly lists `npm run cypress:run` and `npm run cypress:open`
   - Trust project configuration before trying alternatives
   - Verify documented commands fail before seeking workarounds

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**

   - "Do these npm scripts work for you?"
   - "What errors do you see when tests run?"
   - "Are the tests passing or failing?"

3. **Verify Assumptions**
   - Don't assume commands don't work
   - Don't bypass project configuration without cause
   - Check documentation before trying alternative approaches

## Questions for User

To properly diagnose and fix the issues, I need clarification:

1. **Do these commands work for you without errors?**

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts"
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

2. **When you run them, do you see:**

   - ‚úÖ Tests execute successfully?
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Vite errors but tests still run?
   - üî¥ Cypress verification errors but UI opens?
   - ‚ùå Complete failure like shown above?

3. **Does your Cypress UI open and can you run tests manually?**

---

## Recommended Next Steps

**Pending User Clarification:**

### If Tests Run Despite Errors

- Focus on fixing Vite Flow syntax errors
- Tests may be passing, just with build warnings

### If Cypress Opens But Tests Fail

- Focus on test assertions
- Vite errors may be blocking app functionality

### If Nothing Works

- Investigate why user reports commands work
- May be environment-specific differences
- Need to understand what "working" means

---

## Safeguards To Implement

### 1. CLAUDE.md Documentation Enhancement

Add prominent warning:

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always Use npm Scripts

**NEVER use `npx cypress` or `cypress` commands directly**

‚úÖ CORRECT:
npm run cypress:open
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "path/to/test.cy.ts"

‚ùå WRONG:
npx cypress open
npx cypress run --spec "path/to/test.cy.ts"
```

### 2. Add Command Verification Checklist

- Before running commands, check CLAUDE.md first
- Verify npm scripts exist in package.json
- Ask user if documented commands work before alternatives
- Don't bypass project configuration without explicit reason

### 3. Add Test Execution Section

Document the complete execution flow:

- Pre-test cleanup
- Server startup
- Cypress verification
- Test execution
- Expected outputs
