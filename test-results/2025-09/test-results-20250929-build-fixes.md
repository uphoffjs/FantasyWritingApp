# Test Results: verify-login-page.cy.ts

**Date:** 2025-09-29
**Status:** Build Issues RESOLVED ✅

## Summary of Completed Tasks

### ✅ All Critical Build Issues Fixed:

1. **Fixed duplicate minify key in vite.config.js**

   - Removed duplicate `minify: true` on line 224
   - Kept `minify: 'terser'` configuration

2. **Removed missing @react-navigation/stack dependency**

   - Removed from optimizeDeps.include in vite.config.js

3. **Fixed React Native Flow type syntax issues**

   - Added babel preset configuration for Flow types
   - Added ESBuild configuration to handle JSX in .js files
   - Excluded react-native packages from optimization

4. **Addressed phantom dependencies for mobile-only packages**

   - Created empty module aliases for:
     - react-native-document-picker
     - react-native-fs
     - react-native-share
   - Added alias for react-native-vector-icons

5. **Fixed react-native-dotenv package issue**

   - Removed from babel plugins (not needed)

6. **Fixed worker.plugins configuration**

   - Changed from array to function returning array

7. **Created missing polyfills file**
   - Added react-native-web-polyfills.js

## Current Status

### ✅ Build & Server:

- Vite dev server starts successfully on port 3002
- Server remains stable and responds to HTTP requests
- No more Flow type syntax errors
- No more missing dependency errors
- HMR (Hot Module Reload) working

### ✅ Cypress Test Execution:

- Cypress can connect to the dev server
- Tests execute without server crashes
- Build capture debug info working correctly

### ⚠️ Test Results:

- Test fails to find login page elements (`[data-cy="email-input"]`)
- This is a UI/component issue, NOT a build issue
- The test infrastructure is working correctly

## Files Modified

1. **vite.config.js** - Multiple fixes for build configuration
2. **src/utils/empty-module.js** - Created for mobile package aliases
3. **src/utils/react-native-web-polyfills.js** - Created for missing polyfills
4. **todo.md** - Updated with completed tasks

## Next Steps

The build and test execution infrastructure is now working correctly. The remaining issue is that the login page elements are not being rendered or don't have the correct data-cy attributes. This is a separate UI issue that needs to be investigated:

1. Check if LoginScreen component is rendering correctly
2. Verify testID attributes are properly converted to data-cy on web
3. Check routing to ensure login page loads at '/'

## Console Output

The server now starts with only one warning:

```
The CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated.
```

This is a non-critical deprecation warning that doesn't affect functionality.

## Verification

To verify the fixes:

```bash
npm run web           # Server starts on port 3002 ✅
npm run cypress:run   # Tests can execute ✅
```

The critical build blocking issues have been successfully resolved!
