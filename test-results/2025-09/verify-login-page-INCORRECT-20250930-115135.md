# Cypress Test Results - verify-login-page.cy.ts (Chrome Browser Attempt)

---

**Test File:** `cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts`
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30 11:51:35
**Status:** ❌ FAILED (Cypress Binary Verification Issue)
**Duration:** N/A (Failed before execution)
**Platform:** darwin-x64 (macOS - 15.7)
**Cypress Version:** 15.3.0 (upgraded from 14.5.4)
**Node Version:** v22.19.0
**Vite Version:** 5.4.20
**Browser Attempted:** Chrome (as alternative to Electron)

---

## Executive Summary

**Result:** Cypress binary fails verification on macOS Sequoia 15.7 regardless of browser choice. Chrome browser flag did not bypass the issue because Cypress fails at the verification stage before browser selection occurs.

**Primary Issue:** Cypress 15.3.0 binary verification rejects required command-line options on macOS 15.7 (Sequoia)

**Upgrade Attempt:** Upgrading from Cypress 14.5.4 to 15.3.0 did NOT resolve the issue

**Chrome Browser Attempt:** Specifying `--browser chrome` did NOT bypass the issue because verification fails before browser selection

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: macOS Sequoia Electron Binary Incompatibility

**Problem:** macOS 15.7 (Sequoia) has stricter security policies that prevent Cypress's Electron-based binary from accepting standard command-line options.

**Why Version Upgrade Failed:**
Both Cypress 14.5.4 and 15.3.0 use similar Electron versions that have the same compatibility issue with macOS Sequoia 15.7. The problem is in the Electron framework, not Cypress itself.

**Why Chrome Flag Failed:**
The `--browser chrome` flag is processed AFTER Cypress binary verification. The verification step (`--no-sandbox`, `--smoke-test`, `--ping`) happens before any browser selection, so specifying Chrome doesn't bypass the issue.

**Execution Flow:**

```
1. Cypress binary verification (FAILS HERE ❌)
   └─ Uses --no-sandbox, --smoke-test, --ping flags
   └─ macOS Sequoia rejects these options
2. Browser selection (NEVER REACHED)
   └─ Would select Chrome or Electron
3. Test execution (NEVER REACHED)
```

**Evidence:**

```
Platform: darwin-x64 (macOS - 15.7)
Cypress Version: 15.3.0
Node.js v22.19.0
```

The error occurs at the "Verifying Cypress can run" stage, which is the initial binary validation before any test or browser configuration is applied.

| Solution                        | Status       | Result                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Upgrade Cypress 14.5.4 → 15.3.0 | ✅ Completed | ❌ Did not fix issue    |
| Use Chrome instead of Electron  | ✅ Attempted | ❌ Did not bypass issue |
| Force reinstall binary          | ✅ Completed | ❌ Did not fix issue    |

## Secondary Issue: Vite Build Errors (Still Present)

When the server is accessed (during failed test attempts), Vite Flow syntax errors persist:

**Affected Files:**

- `react-native/Libraries/Animated/nodes/AnimatedProps.js`
- `react-native/src/private/animated/NativeAnimatedHelper.js`
- `react-native/src/private/animated/createAnimatedPropsHook.js`
- `react-native/Libraries/Pressability/Pressability.js`
- `react-native/src/private/featureflags/ReactNativeFeatureFlagsBase.js`

**Error Pattern:**

```
ERROR: Expected "from" but found "{"
```

This indicates Flow type syntax that Vite cannot parse, despite:

- ✅ Adding `@babel/plugin-transform-flow-strip-types` to vite.config.ts
- ✅ Expanding `optimizeDeps.exclude` list
- ✅ Clearing Vite cache

**Why This Persists:**
The babel plugin only applies to source files being transformed by the React plugin, not to dependency optimization or node_modules files that Vite pre-bundles.

---

## Remaining Options

### Option 1: Try Cypress Open Mode (Interactive) ⭐ RECOMMENDED NEXT

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

**Why This Might Work:**

- Interactive mode uses different initialization
- May bypass the problematic CLI verification flags
- Would allow manual browser selection in UI
- Could reveal if tests can run at all

### Option 2: Environment Variable Workarounds

Try disabling sandbox mode through environment variables:

```bash
export ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX=1
export CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT=60000
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/verify-login-page.cy.ts"
```

### Option 3: Downgrade to Pre-Sequoia Compatible Cypress

Research if any Cypress version explicitly supports macOS Sequoia 15.7:

```bash
npm install cypress@13.15.2  # Last known stable on older macOS
```

### Option 4: Use Different Test Environment

- Run tests in Docker container
- Use GitHub Actions / CI environment
- Use a macOS VM with older version
- Use Linux environment if available

### Option 5: Address Vite Build Issues First

Since Cypress can't run at all, focus on fixing the Vite Flow syntax errors:

1. Investigate which components import React Native Animated
2. Verify all imports use react-native-web aliases
3. Add more specific module resolution rules
4. Test app loads in browser manually (without Cypress)

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Priority:**

1. ✅ **Try Cypress Open Mode** (Option 1)

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

   This is the most likely solution as interactive mode may bypass CLI verification

2. **If Open Mode Works:**

   - Manually run the test through the UI
   - Confirm app loads and test can execute
   - Document which mode works (open vs run)
   - Update npm scripts to use open mode if necessary

3. **If Open Mode Fails:**
   - Try environment variable workarounds (Option 2)
   - Consider downgrading Cypress (Option 3)
   - Focus on Vite build issues independently (Option 5)

**Secondary Priority:**

4. **Address Vite Build Errors:**
   - These will block tests even if Cypress starts working
   - Need to prevent React Native Animated module imports
   - May require refactoring components to use react-native-web equivalents

## Test Assertions Status

**N/A** - Test suite did not execute. No assertions were evaluated due to Cypress binary verification failure.

---

## Conclusion

The Cypress upgrade and Chrome browser attempts were unsuccessful. The issue is a fundamental incompatibility between Cypress's Electron-based verification system and macOS Sequoia 15.7's security policies.

**Next Action:** Try Cypress interactive mode (`npm run cypress:open`) as it may use a different initialization path that bypasses the problematic verification flags.
