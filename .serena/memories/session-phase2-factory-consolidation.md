## Factory Consolidation Details

### Files Deleted
- `cypress/fixtures/factories.ts` - Old monolithic file (254 lines)
- `cypress/fixtures/factories/projectFactory.js` - Duplicate of project.factory.ts

### Files Renamed/Converted
- `elementFactory.js` → `element.factory.ts` (373 lines)
- `userFactory.js` → `user.factory.ts` (224 lines)

### Files Updated
- `cypress/fixtures/factories/index.ts` - Now exports all factories with proper naming

### Final Factory Structure
```
cypress/fixtures/factories/
├── character.factory.ts ✅
├── element.factory.ts ✅ (converted from JS)
├── project.factory.ts ✅
├── story.factory.ts ✅
├── user.factory.ts ✅ (converted from JS)
├── factory-tasks.js (utility file, kept)
└── index.ts ✅ (updated exports)
```

## Verification Results

**Linting:** ✅ Pass  
- No new errors introduced
- Only pre-existing selector warnings remain
- Factory imports all resolved correctly

**Import Check:** ✅ Pass  
- No broken imports found
- All test files using old factory names updated

---

## Remaining Phase 2 Tasks (5 of 11)

1. ⏳ Update scene-editor.cy.ts selectors (cy.contains → data-cy)
2. ⏳ Update character-full-workflow.cy.ts selectors
3. ⏳ Mark deprecated commands with @deprecated JSDoc tags
4. ⏳ Update command-verification.cy.ts to use new commands
5. ⏳ Migrate deprecated command usage across test suite

---

## Overall Progress

**Total:** 10 of 23 tasks (43%)  
**Phase 1:** 4 of 4 (100%) ✅  
**Phase 2:** 6 of 11 (55%) 🟡  
**Phase 3:** 0 of 8 (0%) ⏸️

---

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Naming Convention:** All factories now use `*.factory.ts` pattern
2. **Export Strategy:** Central index.ts exports all factories
3. **TypeScript Migration:** Converted JS factories to TS without adding types yet
4. **Backward Compatibility:** Export names maintained for existing imports

---

## Next Steps

**Option 1:** Continue with Phase 2  
- Selector updates (scene-editor, character-full-workflow)
- Deprecated command migration

**Option 2:** Move to Phase 3  
- Test organization
- TypeScript migrations (test files)
- Cleanup duplicates

**Option 3:** Stop and review  
- Significant progress made (43% complete)
- Good stopping point for review
