# Context Recovery Session - 2025-10-09

## Situation

User reported that the last conversation ran out of context and was unable to save it. This session is focused on recovering and preserving any available context.

## Current State

- **Working directory**: /Users/jacobuphoff/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp
- **Git branch**: feature/cypress-test-coverage (main: main)
- **Date**: 2025-10-09
- **User action**: Opened CLAUDE.md file

## Recent Work Context (from git status)

The feature branch has extensive work on authentication testing:

**Modified TODO files**: All auth test phase TODOs updated (phases 1-5)
**Modified Cypress files**: \_smoke-test.cy.ts, fixtures, support files
**Modified source**: LoginScreen components, authStore
**New files**: signin-flow tests, cleanup scripts, auth documentation

## Recent Commits

- perf(test): implement persistent server for 48% faster test execution
- fix(test): resolve EADDRINUSE port conflicts with enhanced cleanup
- feat(test): add flakiness testing infrastructure and migration system

## Available Memories (41 total)

Most recent relevant memories:

- phase2_test_debugging_session_2025-10-08 (MOST RECENT)
- auth_tests_phase_2_status_2025-10-07
- auth_tests_phase_2_implementation_2025-10-07

- auth_test_seeding_strategy_2025-10-07
- supabase_migration_system_2025-10-06
- session_checkpoint_2025-10-06

## Recovery Actions

1. ✅ Activated FantasyWritingApp project
2. ✅ Created recovery checkpoint
3. Next: Read recent memories to understand work context
4. Next: Establish proper checkpointing workflow

## Workflow Recommendations

Based on CLAUDE.md Context Management guidelines:

**The Golden Sequence™** (use every 90 minutes):

```bash
/sc:save                          # Save config
write_memory("checkpoint", state) # Save context
/clear                           # Clear conversation
/sc:load                         # Reload config
read_memory("checkpoint")        # Restore context
```

**Essential Memory Keys**:

- "checkpoint" - Current work state
- "EOD" - End of day summary
- "feature\_[name]" - Feature-specific context
- "bug\_[id]" - Debug session state

## What User Should Know

The previous conversation likely contained valuable context that wasn't saved. To recover:

1. I can read the most recent memories (especially phase2_test_debugging_session_2025-10-08)
2. Git status shows active work on auth testing
3. Going forward: Use /sc:save + write_memory every 30-60 minutes
