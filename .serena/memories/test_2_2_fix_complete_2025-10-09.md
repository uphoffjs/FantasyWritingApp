# Test 2.2 Fix Complete - 2025-10-09

## Problem Summary

Test 2.2 (Invalid Credentials) was failing because the error message was not displaying after authentication failure. The error state was set but never rendered in the DOM.

## Root Cause

**React State Race Condition with Zustand**

When `signIn()` failed and returned an error:

1. LoginScreen set local error state with `setError(errorMessage)`
2. authStore's `finally` block set `isLoading: false`
3. Zustand state change triggered LoginScreen re-render
4. LoginScreen re-rendered with OLD state (error still null)
5. By the time React processed the `setError`, the component had already re-rendered
6. Result: Error never displayed

## Solution

**Moved error state from local React useState to Zustand authStore**

### Files Modified

**src/store/authStore.ts**:

- Added `authError: string | null` to AuthStore interface
- Added `clearAuthError()` method
- Modified `signIn()` to set `authError` in store on failure
- Clears `authError` on success or new sign-in attempt

**src/screens/LoginScreen.web.tsx**:

- Removed local `error` state
- Added `authError` and `clearAuthError` from `useAuthStore()`
- Created `validationError` for local validation errors
- Combined errors: `const error = authError || validationError`
- Updated all error handling to use appropriate error state

### Why This Works

Zustand state updates are processed immediately within the same batch as other Zustand updates (`isLoading`). This prevents the race condition where local React state updates were lost during Zustand-triggered re-renders.

## Test Results

✅ Test 2.1 (Valid Credentials): PASSING
✅ Test 2.2 (Invalid Credentials): PASSING

Both tests now pass consistently.

## Key Learnings

1. Local React state can be lost when external state management (Zustand) triggers re-renders
2. For UI state that depends on store actions, consider storing it in the store itself
3. `flushSync()` doesn't help when the issue is re-rendering with stale state
4. Zustand updates in the same action are batched together, preventing race conditions

## Next Steps

- Continue with Test 2.3 (Remember Me) when ready
- Consider applying this pattern to other authentication flows
- Consider using authStore for other UI state tied to auth actions
