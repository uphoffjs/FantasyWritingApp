# Webpack Baseline Performance Metrics

**Date Recorded**: 2025-09-24
**Current Build Tool**: Webpack 5.101.3
**Platform**: macOS Darwin 24.6.0

## Current Performance Metrics

### 🏗️ Build Performance
- **Production Build (`npm run build:web`)**: ❌ Currently failing
  - Error: Module resolution issues with @react-native-async-storage
  - 122 errors total
  - Approximate time before failure: ~13 seconds
  - Status: Needs fixing before migration

### 🧪 Test Performance
- **Component Tests (`npm run test:component`)**:
  - **Execution Time**: 3-5 minutes (extremely slow)
  - **Test Count**: 75 component test files
  - **Browser**: Electron headless
  - **Known Issues**:
    - Timeouts frequent
    - Webpack compilation slow (3-5 seconds initial build)
    - Some tests failing due to selector issues

### 🚀 Development Server
- **Dev Server Start (`npm run web`)**:
  - **Startup Time**: 4-5 seconds
  - **Port**: 3002
  - **HMR**: Variable/slow performance
  - **Initial Bundle**: Large, no code splitting

### 📦 Bundle Analysis
- **Bundle Size**: Not available (build failing)
- **Code Splitting**: Not implemented
- **Tree Shaking**: Limited effectiveness

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Build Failures**: AsyncStorage module resolution errors preventing production builds
2. **Test Performance**: 3-5 minute test runs unacceptable for development workflow
3. **Dev Experience**: Slow HMR and startup times impacting productivity
4. **Bundle Optimization**: No code splitting or effective tree shaking

## Migration Goals

| Metric | Current (Webpack) | Target (Vite) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Dev Server Startup | 4-5 seconds | <1 second | 80% faster |
| HMR Update | Variable/slow | <100ms | 10x faster |
| Component Tests | 3-5 minutes | 15-30 seconds | 90% faster |
| Production Build | Failed/~30s when working | 10-20 seconds | 50% faster |
| Bundle Size | Baseline | -20% | 20% smaller |

## Pre-Migration State Summary

The project is currently experiencing significant performance issues with Webpack:
- Production builds are broken
- Test execution is prohibitively slow
- Development experience is hampered by slow rebuilds

This makes the Vite migration critical for:
1. Restoring production build capability
2. Improving developer productivity
3. Enabling faster CI/CD cycles
4. Reducing bundle size and improving app performance
