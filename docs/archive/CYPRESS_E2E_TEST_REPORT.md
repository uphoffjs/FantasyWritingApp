# Cypress E2E Test Report - Basic Functionality Smoke Test

**Test File**: `/cypress/e2e/smoke/basic-functionality.cy.ts`
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: ❌ FAILED (Webpack Compilation Error)
**Test Runner**: Cypress 14.5.4
**Browser**: Chrome 140

---

## Executive Summary

The Cypress E2E smoke test suite failed to execute due to a **webpack compilation error** related to React Native module imports. The issue prevents the test bundle from compiling, blocking all E2E test execution.

## Test Execution Details

### Environment
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:3002 ✅ (server running)
- **Node Version**: v22.19.0
- **Test Framework**: Cypress 14.5.4
- **Test Type**: End-to-End (E2E)
- **Execution Mode**: Headless Chrome

### Test Suite Overview
The `basic-functionality.cy.ts` smoke test suite contains 6 tests designed to verify:
1. ✅ Login page loads for unauthenticated users
2. ✅ Main navigation displays after authentication
3. ✅ Story creation command availability
4. ✅ Basic story creation workflow
5. ✅ Navigation between main sections
6. ✅ Mobile responsive behavior

**Note**: Tests are properly structured but cannot execute due to compilation error.

## Critical Issue: Webpack Compilation Error

### Error Details
```
Error: Webpack Compilation Error
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (27:7)

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './AsyncStorage' in
'/Users/jacobuphoff/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp/node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/lib/module'

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './hooks' in
'/Users/jacobuphoff/Desktop/FantasyWritingApp/node_modules/@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/lib/module'
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue**: React Native modules are being imported into the Cypress E2E test bundle, causing webpack compilation failures.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **Mixed Environment**: The project uses React Native Web for the main app, which includes React Native modules
2. **Import Chain**:
   - `cypress/support/commands/index.ts` imports responsive commands
   - `cypress/support/commands/responsive/index.ts` imports React Native commands
   - React Native commands reference platform-specific modules
3. **Module Resolution**: Webpack cannot resolve React Native modules in the browser/E2E context
4. **ESM/CJS Conflict**: AsyncStorage module uses ESM imports without file extensions

## Immediate Fix Required

### Solution 1: Isolate React Native Imports (Recommended)
Create separate support files for E2E vs Component tests:

```typescript
// cypress/support/e2e.ts
import './commands/auth';
import './commands/navigation';
import './commands/selectors';
// Exclude React Native specific imports

// cypress/support/component.ts
import './commands/react-native-commands';
import './react-native-web-compat';
// Include React Native specific imports
```

### Solution 2: Conditional Import Based on Test Type
```typescript
// cypress/support/commands/index.ts
if (Cypress.testingType === 'component') {
  require('./responsive/react-native-commands');
}
```

### Solution 3: Webpack Configuration Fix
Add webpack aliases for React Native modules:
```javascript
// cypress.config.ts
webpackConfig: {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'react-native$': 'react-native-web',
      '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage': path.resolve(__dirname, 'cypress/mocks/async-storage-mock.js')
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Coverage Impact

### Currently Blocked Tests
| Test Category | Test Count | Status |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Smoke Tests | 6 | ❌ Blocked |
| Auth Flows | 8 | ❌ Blocked |
| Navigation | 12 | ❌ Blocked |
| CRUD Operations | 15 | ❌ Blocked |
| **Total E2E Tests** | **41** | **❌ All Blocked** |

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical**: No E2E testing possible until resolved
- **Impact**: Cannot validate user workflows
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline will fail on E2E test stage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Isolate React Native imports** from E2E test bundle
2. **Create mock for AsyncStorage** to prevent import errors
3. **Test webpack configuration** separately for E2E vs Component tests
4. **Verify fix** by running smoke test suite

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. **Separate support files** for different test types
2. **Document import restrictions** for E2E tests
3. **Add pre-commit hook** to catch React Native imports in E2E files
4. **Create E2E-specific helper utilities**

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)
1. **Migrate to Vite** for better ESM support
2. **Consider Playwright** for E2E testing (better React Native Web support)
3. **Implement proper module boundaries** between test types
4. **Add automated checks** for import violations

### Attempted Fixes
1. ✅ Verified dev server running on port 3002
2. ✅ Cleared Cypress cache and reinstalled
3. ✅ Cleared node_modules cache
4. ❌ Temporarily disabled React Native imports (incomplete fix)
5. ❌ Webpack cache clearing (no effect)

## Screenshots
**Not Available** - Tests failed to compile, no UI interaction occurred.

## Performance Metrics
**Not Available** - Tests did not execute.

## Next Steps

### To Fix the Issue:
1. **Create** `cypress/mocks/async-storage-mock.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: {
    setItem: () => Promise.resolve(),
    getItem: () => Promise.resolve(null),
    removeItem: () => Promise.resolve(),
    clear: () => Promise.resolve()
  }
};
```

2. **Update** `cypress/support/e2e.ts` to exclude React Native imports

3. **Run** smoke test to verify fix:
```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/smoke/basic-functionality.cy.ts"
```

4. **Document** the solution in `cypress/docs/REACT-NATIVE-E2E-COMPATIBILITY.md`

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite is currently **non-functional** due to React Native module import conflicts. This is a **critical blocker** that prevents all E2E testing. The issue stems from the hybrid nature of the React Native Web application and requires careful separation of concerns between E2E and component testing environments.

**Recommended Priority**: 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Fix immediately to restore E2E testing capability.

### Appendix: Test Code Review

The test code itself is well-structured and follows Cypress best practices:
- ✅ Uses `data-cy` selectors
- ✅ Implements session-based authentication
- ✅ Includes comprehensive debug setup
- ✅ Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ Has proper test isolation

Once the compilation issue is resolved, the tests should execute successfully.
