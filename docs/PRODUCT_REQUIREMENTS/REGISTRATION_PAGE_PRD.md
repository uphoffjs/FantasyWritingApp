    And I am logged into the app

  Scenario: Verification email received
    Then I should receive a verification email
    And the email should contain a verification link
    And the email should be from the app domain
    And the subject should be "Verify your email"

  Scenario: Using app before verification
    Given my email is not yet verified
    When I navigate to the Projects page
    Then I should be able to create projects
    And I should see a notice about email verification
    But I should not be blocked from using features

  Scenario: Resend verification email
    Given my email is not verified
    When I request to resend verification email
    Then a new verification email should be sent
    And I should see "Verification email sent" message
    And the previous verification link should still work

  Scenario: Verification status check
    When the app checks my verification status
    Then the auth store should reflect my verification state
    And the UI should update accordingly
    And verified users should not see verification prompts
```

### Scenario: Form Validation

```gherkin
Feature: Registration Form Validation
  As a new user
  I want clear validation feedback
  So that I can correct errors before submission

  Background:
    Given I am on the registration form

  Scenario: Real-time email validation
    When I enter "invalid@" in the email field
    And I move to the password field
    Then I should see "Enter a valid email" error
    When I correct it to "valid@example.com"
    Then the error should disappear

  Scenario: Password matching validation
    When I enter "password123" in the password field
    And I enter "password456" in the confirm password field
    And I move focus away
    Then I should see "Passwords do not match" error
    When I correct the confirm password to "password123"
    Then the error should disappear

  Scenario: Empty field validation
    When I click "Create Account" without filling any fields
    Then I should see "Email is required" error
    And I should see "Password is required" error
    And the form should not be submitted

  Scenario: Multiple validation errors
    When I enter "bad" in the email field
    And I enter "12" in the password field
    And I enter "34" in the confirm password field
    And I click "Create Account"

  Background:
    Given I am on the registration form
    And I have entered valid registration details

  Scenario: Loading during account creation
    When I click "Create Account"
    Then the button should show a loading spinner
    And the button text should change to "Creating account..."
    And all form inputs should be disabled
    And the tab switcher should be disabled
    When registration completes
    Then the loading state should clear
    And appropriate success/error should be shown

  Scenario: Network timeout handling
    Given the network is slow
    When I submit the registration form
    And the request takes longer than 30 seconds
    Then I should see a timeout error
    And the form should be re-enabled
    And I should be able to retry
