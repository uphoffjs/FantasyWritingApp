# Morphllm MCP Server

**Purpose**: Pattern-based code editing engine with token optimization for bulk transformations

## Triggers

- Multi-file edit operations requiring consistent patterns
- Framework updates, style guide enforcement, code cleanup
- Bulk text replacements across multiple files
- Natural language edit instructions with specific scope
- Token optimization needed (efficiency gains 30-50%)

## Choose When

- **Over Serena**: For pattern-based edits, not symbol operations
- **For bulk operations**: Style enforcement, framework updates, text replacements
- **When token efficiency matters**: Fast Apply scenarios with compression needs
- **For simple to moderate complexity**: <10 files, straightforward transformations
- **Not for semantic operations**: Symbol renames, dependency tracking, LSP integration

## Works Best With

- **Serena**: Serena analyzes semantic context → Morphllm executes precise edits
- **Sequential**: Sequential plans edit strategy → Morphllm applies systematic changes

## Examples

```
"update all React class components to hooks" → Morphllm (pattern transformation)
"enforce ESLint rules across project" → Morphllm (style guide application)
"replace all console.log with logger calls" → Morphllm (bulk text replacement)
"rename getUserData function everywhere" → Serena (symbol operation)
"analyze code architecture" → Sequential (complex analysis)
"explain this algorithm" → Native Claude (simple explanation)
```
