# Session Checkpoint - Project Page Redesign
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Branch**: feature/update-projects-page

## Session Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

#### Git Operations
- Committed all changes from debug/general-app-issues branch
- Successfully merged debug branch into dev branch
- Created new feature branch: `feature/update-projects-page`
- All changes related to project deletion and sync issues are now in dev

#### Design & Planning
- Created comprehensive design document for project page redesign
- Developed detailed implementation TODO with 8-week roadmap
- Established design vision: Scrivener-inspired with subtle fantasy theme

### üìã Key Decisions Made

1. **Design Direction**: Professional first, fantasy second - clean UI with subtle fantasy accents
2. **Target Platforms**: Mobile/web/desktop web (no desktop app)
3. **Sync Strategy**: Cloud-sync priority with real-time synchronization
4. **User Experience**: More like Scrivener but with fantasy feel, no gamification for MVP
5. **Scope**: Full version design with ability to cut features as needed

### üé® Design System Established

#### Visual Identity
- **Light Theme**: "Parchment & Ink" - aged parchment backgrounds with rich brown ink
- **Dark Theme**: "Midnight Scriptorium" - dark leather with cream text
- **Typography**: 
  - Headers: Cinzel (fantasy serif)
  - Body: Crimson Pro (readable serif)
  - UI: Inter (clean sans-serif)

#### Layout Architecture
- **Desktop**: 3-column layout (sidebar + main canvas + inspector)
- **Tablet**: 2-column layout with overlay inspector
- **Mobile**: Single column with bottom navigation

#### Key Components Designed
1. Project Dashboard (main landing page)
2. Element Management System (World Codex)
3. Enhanced Writing Editor
4. Inspector Panel (contextual)
5. Global Navigation & Search

### üìÅ Files Created

1. `/docs/PROJECT_PAGE_REDESIGN.md` - Complete design specification
2. `/TODO_PROJECT_REDESIGN.md` - Implementation roadmap with prioritized tasks

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### Phase 1 Priority (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up theme system with light/dark modes
- [ ] Create responsive layout architecture
- [ ] Build base component library
- [ ] Implement AppShell with responsive breakpoints

#### Phase 2 Priority (Week 2) 
- [ ] Build new Project Dashboard
- [ ] Create ProjectCard components
- [ ] Implement grid/list view toggle
- [ ] Add hero stats section

### üí° Key Insights

1. **User First Impression**: The project page is the first thing users see - needs to be compelling and functional
2. **Fantasy Balance**: Users want fantasy atmosphere but prioritize clean, professional UI
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Unified experience across all platforms is critical
4. **Information Density**: Users want to see more information without excessive scrolling (Scrivener-like)

### üîß Technical Considerations

- Using React Native's built-in components for consistency
- Implementing with TypeScript for type safety
- Leveraging existing Zustand store for state management
- Planning for virtual scrolling on large lists
- Code splitting for performance optimization

### üìä Success Metrics Defined

- Time to create first project: < 30 seconds
- Page load time: < 2 seconds  
- Sync lag: < 500ms perceived
- Mobile usability score: > 95/100
- Session length increase: +30%
- Projects created per user: +50%

### üéØ Current Branch State

- Branch: `feature/update-projects-page`
- Status: Clean working tree, ready for implementation
- Parent: dev branch (up to date)

### üîÑ Session Context

This session focused on:
1. Resolving outstanding git operations and merging fixes
2. Brainstorming and designing the project page redesign
3. Creating comprehensive documentation for implementation
4. Setting up the feature branch for development

The design balances professional writing tools with subtle fantasy atmosphere, prioritizing functionality while maintaining the creative spirit that inspires fantasy writers. Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation in the next session.
