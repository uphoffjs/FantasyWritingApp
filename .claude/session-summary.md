#### Summary Documentation
10. **CYPRESS-SUMMARY.md**
    - Consolidated key concepts
    - Quick reference guide
    - Essential patterns and rules
    - Testing checklist
    - Troubleshooting guide

#### Existing Documentation (3 files)
- REACT_NATIVE_WEB_QUIRKS.md
- SELECTOR-PATTERNS.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Project Insights

#### Testing Philosophy
- **Mandatory Rule**: ONLY use `data-cy` attributes for selectors
- **React Native Web**: Use `testID` in components (converts to `data-cy`)
- **Test Independence**: Each test must be completely isolated
- **State Management**: Clean state in `beforeEach`, not `afterEach`

#### Project-Specific Patterns
- Fantasy worldbuilding elements (characters, locations, magic systems)
- Project/story organization
- Element relationships and questionnaires
- Template system

### ðŸ”§ Technical Decisions Made

1. **Documentation Organization**
   - All Cypress docs centralized in `/cypress/docs/`
   - Individual topic files for deep dives
   - Summary file for quick reference

2. **Testing Standards Enforced**
   - `data-cy` as the ONLY acceptable selector
   - Better Comments syntax integration
   - React Native Web specific considerations
   - Performance and accessibility focus

3. **Code Examples**
   - All examples use FantasyWritingApp domain concepts
   - Real-world scenarios (projects, elements, stories)
   - Platform-specific handling demonstrated

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps Recommendations

1. **Implement Custom Commands**
   - Create reusable commands for common operations
   - Add TypeScript definitions for commands
   - Test helpers for element creation/management

2. **Write Core Tests**
   - Critical user paths (signup â†’ project â†’ elements)
   - Component tests for React Native components
   - API tests for backend operations

3. **Configure CI/CD**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for test runs
   - Configure parallel test execution
   - Add test reporting

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance tests
   - Monitor bundle sizes
   - Test on various viewports

### ðŸ”— Resources Created

All documentation files are in `/cypress/docs/` with:
- Comprehensive coverage of Cypress concepts
- FantasyWritingApp-specific examples
- React Native Web integration patterns
- Quick reference summary for development

### ðŸ’¡ Session Learning Points

1. **React Native Web Testing**: Special considerations for `testID` â†’ `data-cy` conversion
2. **Documentation Structure**: Balance between comprehensive coverage and quick reference
3. **Project Context**: Fantasy writing app with elements, projects, and relationships
4. **Testing Philosophy**: Strict selector rules, test isolation, and user-centric testing
