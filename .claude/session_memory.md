*Last Updated: 2025-09-18*

## Current Project State

### Active Branch: feature/html-mockups
- **Previous Work**: Better Comments implementation completed and merged
- **Current Focus**: Design system planning with HTML mockups approach
- **Next Milestone**: Implementation of mockup structure for rapid design iteration

### Recent Accomplishments

#### 1. Better Comments Implementation (COMPLETED âœ…)
- **Scope**: Applied Better Comments patterns across 203 files
  - 88 files in `src/` directory
  - 115 files in `cypress/` directory
- **Policy Added**: Updated CLAUDE.md with Better Comments development policy
- **Commit**: Successfully committed with ID 034e52f
- **Merge**: Merged feature/update-claude-md into dev branch

#### 2. Git Workflow Progress
- **Branch History**:
  - âœ… feature/update-claude-md â†’ merged to dev
  - ðŸ”„ feature/html-mockups â†’ current active branch
- **Pending**: TODO.md file ready for commit on current branch

#### 3. Design System Strategy (IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„)
- **Approach**: Dual-phase hybrid strategy
  - **Phase 1**: HTML mockups for rapid design iteration
  - **Phase 2**: Storybook integration for component documentation
  - **Phase 3**: Integration workflow combining both approaches
  - **Phase 4**: Advanced features for ongoing development

### Key Strategic Decisions

#### Design System Architecture
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Primary focus on mobile React Native experience
2. **Component-Based**: Atomic design principles with hierarchical structure
3. **Live Preview**: HTML mockups for immediate visual feedback
4. **Documentation**: Long-term Storybook integration for component library

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Rapid Prototyping**: HTML mockups allow quick design iteration
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure designs work on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Component Library**: Build reusable component documentation
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, typography across platforms

### Technical Context

#### Project Stack
- **Framework**: React Native 0.75.4 with TypeScript
- **Testing**: Cypress for web E2E testing
- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Web (React Native Web)

#### Development Environment
- **Web Dev Server**: Running on port 3002
- **Testing**: Cypress component testing configured
- **Git**: Multiple feature branches for organized development
- **Code Quality**: Better Comments for enhanced code documentation

### Immediate Next Steps

#### Phase 1 Implementation (PENDING)
1. **Mockup Structure Setup**:
   - Create `design-mockups/` directory structure
   - Set up HTML template system
   - Configure Live Preview integration
   - Implement responsive breakpoint testing

2. **Core Components**:
   - Story creation and editing interfaces
   - Character management screens
   - Chapter organization views
   - Navigation and layout systems

3. **Design Validation**:
   - Mobile viewport testing (iPhone, Android)
   - Tablet layout verification (iPad)
   - Desktop responsive behavior
   - Cross-platform consistency checks

#### Technical Debt & Considerations
- **Better Comments**: Maintain consistent commenting patterns in new code
- **Testing**: Ensure mockups support future Cypress test integration
- **Performance**: Consider mockup impact on development workflow speed
- **Accessibility**: Include accessibility considerations in mockup designs

### Session Continuity Notes

#### Context for Next Session
1. **Active Work**: HTML mockup implementation ready to begin
2. **Branch State**: feature/html-mockups with TODO.md pending commit
3. **Design Focus**: Mobile-first React Native creative writing app
4. **Priority**: Quick design iteration capability over comprehensive documentation

#### Important Reminders
- **React Native Focus**: All designs must translate to React Native components
- **Cross-Platform**: Consider iOS, Android, and web experiences
- **User-Centered**: Creative writing workflow optimization
- **Performance**: Keep development iteration speed high

### Development Standards Maintained
- **Testing**: testID/data-cy attributes for all interactive elements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and React Native accessibility
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all new code
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with descriptive commit messages
- **Code Quality**: Better Comments documentation standards
