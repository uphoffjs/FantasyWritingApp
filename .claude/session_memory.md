### Key Strategic Decisions

#### Design System Architecture
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Primary focus on mobile React Native experience
2. **Component-Based**: Atomic design principles with hierarchical structure
3. **Live Preview**: HTML mockups for immediate visual feedback
4. **Documentation**: Long-term Storybook integration for component library

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Rapid Prototyping**: HTML mockups allow quick design iteration
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Ensure designs work on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Component Library**: Build reusable component documentation
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent spacing, colors, typography across platforms

### Technical Context

#### Project Stack
- **Framework**: React Native 0.75.4 with TypeScript
- **Testing**: Cypress for web E2E testing
- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Web (React Native Web)

#### Development Environment
- **Web Dev Server**: Running on port 3002
- **Testing**: Cypress component testing configured
- **Git**: Multiple feature branches for organized development
- **Code Quality**: Better Comments for enhanced code documentation

### Immediate Next Steps

#### Phase 4.3 - CI/CD Integration (PENDING)
1. **GitHub Pages Deployment**:
   - Auto-deploy Storybook to GitHub Pages
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up custom domain if needed
   - Enable automatic deployment on merge

2. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Set up Chromatic or Percy
   - Configure visual snapshots
   - Integrate with PR workflow
   - Establish baseline screenshots

3. **PR Preview Deployments**:
   - Create preview builds for PRs
   - Set up Netlify/Vercel previews
   - Configure automatic cleanup
   - Add status checks to PRs

4. **Design System Versioning**:
   - Implement semantic versioning
   - Create changelog automation
   - Set up release workflow
   - Configure npm publishing pipeline

#### Technical Debt & Considerations
- **Better Comments**: Maintain consistent commenting patterns in new code
- **Testing**: Ensure mockups support future Cypress test integration
- **Performance**: Consider mockup impact on development workflow speed
- **Accessibility**: Include accessibility considerations in mockup designs

### Session Continuity Notes

#### Context for Next Session
1. **Active Work**: HTML mockup implementation ready to begin
2. **Branch State**: feature/html-mockups with TODO.md pending commit
3. **Design Focus**: Mobile-first React Native creative writing app
4. **Priority**: Quick design iteration capability over comprehensive documentation

#### Important Reminders
- **React Native Focus**: All designs must translate to React Native components
- **Cross-Platform**: Consider iOS, Android, and web experiences
- **User-Centered**: Creative writing workflow optimization
- **Performance**: Keep development iteration speed high

### Development Standards Maintained
- **Testing**: testID/data-cy attributes for all interactive elements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and React Native accessibility
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all new code
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with descriptive commit messages
- **Code Quality**: Better Comments documentation standards
