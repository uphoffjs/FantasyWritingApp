# Selector Update Blocker - Feature Components Not Implemented

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED
**Reason:** Target components do not exist in codebase

---

## Summary

The selector update tasks for `scene-editor.cy.ts` and `character-full-workflow.cy.ts` **cannot be completed** because the application features they test (Stories, Scenes, Characters) have not been implemented yet.

---

## Investigation Results

### App Structure (Actual)

**Screens Implemented:**

```
src/screens/
├── ProjectListScreen.tsx      ✅ Exists
├── ProjectScreen.tsx           ✅ Exists
├── ElementScreen.tsx           ✅ Exists
├── LoginScreen.tsx             ✅ Exists
├── SettingsScreen.tsx          ✅ Exists
├── LoadingScreen.tsx           ✅ Exists
└── NotFoundScreen.tsx          ✅ Exists
```

**Routes Available:**

- `/` - Project List
- `/projects` - Project List
- `/projects/:id` - Project Detail
- `/elements/:id` - Element Editor
- `/login` - Login Screen
- `/settings` - Settings

**Components Available:**

- ElementCard, ElementEditor, ElementBrowser
- ProjectCard, ProjectList
- RelationshipManager, RelationshipGraph
- (No Scene or Character specific components)

### Tests Expecting Features (Not Implemented)

**scene-editor.cy.ts:**

- Expects: `/stories` route ❌
- Expects: Scene creation UI ❌
- Expects: Scene editor component ❌
- Expects: Chapter organization ❌
- **Status:** Tests aspirational future features

**character-full-workflow.cy.ts:**

- Expects: `/stories` route ❌
- Expects: Character creation UI ❌
- Expects: Character editor ❌
- Expects: Relationship UI ❌
- **Status:** Tests aspirational future features

---

## Impact on Phase 2 Completion

### Original Plan

- ⏳ Update scene-editor.cy.ts selectors (21 instances)
- ⏳ Update character-full-workflow.cy.ts selectors (26 instances)

### Reality

These tasks **cannot be completed** because:

1. No components exist to add `data-cy` attributes to
2. Tests would fail even with selector updates
3. Features need to be built before tests can pass

### Recommendation

**Mark these tasks as "BLOCKED - Feature Not Implemented"**

---

## What Can Be Done Instead

### Option 1: Skip These Tests (Recommended)

**Action:** Mark tests with `.skip()` until features are implemented

```typescript
describe.skip('Scene Editor and Management', () => {
  // Tests for future feature
});

describe.skip('Character Creation - Full Workflow', () => {
  // Tests for future feature
});
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Tests won't fail in CI/CD
- ✅ Clear indication these are future features
- ✅ Easy to re-enable when features are built

### Option 2: Delete These Tests

**Action:** Remove tests entirely
**When:** If Stories/Scenes/Characters are not planned features

### Option 3: Move to "Future Features" Directory

**Action:** Organize tests by implementation status

```
cypress/e2e/
├── implemented/          # Tests for existing features
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── projects/
│   └── elements/
└── future-features/      # Tests for planned features
    ├── stories/
    ├── scenes/
    └── characters/
```

## Tests That CAN Be Updated (Working Features)

Based on actual app structure, these tests likely have real components:

**Working Tests (can update selectors):**

- ✅ `login-page/verify-login-page.cy.ts` - LoginScreen exists
- ✅ `projects/` tests - ProjectScreen, ProjectCard exist
- ✅ `elements/` tests - ElementScreen, ElementCard exist
- ✅ `auth/authentication.cy.ts` - Auth functionality exists

**Example: Update element tests instead**

```bash
# These would actually work
cypress/e2e/elements/element-creation.cy.ts
cypress/e2e/elements/element-editor.cy.ts
cypress/e2e/projects/project-crud.cy.ts
```

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (This Session)

1. ✅ Document this blocker (this file)
2. Skip unimplementable tests:

   ```typescript
   // Add .skip() to scene-editor.cy.ts
   describe.skip('Scene Editor and Management', () => {

   // Add .skip() to character-full-workflow.cy.ts
   describe.skip('Character Creation - Full Workflow', () => {
   ```

3. Update Phase 2 completion status to reflect reality
4. Mark Phase 2 as "Complete (within scope of existing features)"

### Future (When Features Are Built)

1. Implement Stories/Scenes/Characters screens
2. Add components with `data-cy` attributes from start
3. Re-enable tests (remove `.skip()`)
4. Verify tests pass with new components

---

## Revised Phase 2 Status

### Completable Tasks (9 of 9) ✅

1. ✅ Auto-fixed function expressions
2. ✅ Deleted old factories.ts
3. ✅ Converted elementFactory.js → TS
4. ✅ Converted userFactory.js → TS
5. ✅ Deleted duplicate projectFactory.js
6. ✅ Standardized factory naming
7. ✅ Marked deprecated commands
8. ✅ Updated command-verification.cy.ts
9. ✅ Created migration guide

### Blocked Tasks (2 of 11) ⚠️

10. ⚠️ BLOCKED - scene-editor.cy.ts (no components)
11. ⚠️ BLOCKED - character-full-workflow.cy.ts (no components)

### Adjusted Phase 2 Status

- **Completable:** 100% (9/9) ✅
- **Overall:** 82% (9/11) with 2 blocked by missing features
- **Realistic Status:** Phase 2 Complete for existing features

---

## Alternative Selector Updates (Doable)

If you want to complete selector update work, focus on **implemented features**:

### 1. Element Tests

```bash
# Find element-related cy.contains()
grep -r "cy.contains(" cypress/e2e/elements/
```

### 2. Project Tests

```bash
# Find project-related cy.contains()
grep -r "cy.contains(" cypress/e2e/projects/
```

### 3. Login/Auth Tests

```bash
# Find auth-related cy.contains()
grep -r "cy.contains(" cypress/e2e/auth/
grep -r "cy.contains(" cypress/e2e/login-page/
```

These would have actual components to update!

---

## Conclusion

**Bottom Line:** The selector update tasks are blocked not by technical complexity, but by missing application features. The tests were written aspirationally for future functionality.

**Recommendation:**

1. Mark Phase 2 as "100% complete for existing features"
2. Skip/move the blocked tests
3. Proceed to Phase 3 or stop here with excellent progress

**Phase 2 Achievement:**

- ✅ All critical refactoring complete
- ✅ All factories consolidated
- ✅ All deprecations marked
- ✅ All migration guides created
- ✅ 100% of actionable tasks completed

**Impact:** Clarifies project scope, prevents wasted effort
**Next Steps:** Decide how to handle aspirational tests
