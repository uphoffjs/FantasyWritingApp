- Data Models: 90%
- UI Components: 85%
- Utilities: 95%
- Navigation: 80%
- Error Handlers: 90%

// Coverage Scripts
"test:coverage": "COVERAGE=true npm run web & wait-on http://localhost:3002 && cypress run"
"coverage:report": "nyc report --reporter=html --reporter=text"
"coverage:check": "nyc check-coverage"
```

### 3. **ADVANCED-TESTING-STRATEGY.md**
#### New Major Section Added:
- **Code Coverage Strategy**: Comprehensive 300+ line section covering:
  - Coverage Setup & Configuration for React Native Web
  - Instrumentation for babel and webpack
  - Coverage Goals & Thresholds with component-specific targets
  - Coverage Collection Strategies (E2E, Component, Combined)
  - Coverage Reporting & Analysis with HTML reports
  - CI/CD Integration patterns
  - Custom Coverage Commands and enforcement
  - Coverage Best Practices (incremental improvement, critical paths)
  - Coverage Troubleshooting guide

#### Key Code Examples:
```javascript
// Custom coverage enforcement
Cypress.Commands.add('checkCoverage', (threshold = 80) => {
  cy.task('coverage').then((coverage) => {
    if (lines.pct < threshold) {
      throw new Error(`Coverage ${lines.pct}% below ${threshold}%`)
    }
  })
})

// Component-specific targets
const coverageTargets = {
  'src/auth/**': { lines: 95, branches: 90 },
  'src/models/**': { lines: 90, branches: 85 },
  'src/components/**': { lines: 85, branches: 80 }
}
```

### 4. **cypress-best-practices.md**
#### New Section Added:
- **Code Coverage Best Practices**: Practical guidance including:
  - Setting Up Code Coverage with minimal configuration
  - Coverage Thresholds with realistic targets
  - Writing Tests for Coverage (branches, errors, edge cases)
  - Excluding Code from Coverage (valid exclusions)
  - Coverage Analysis techniques
  - CI/CD Integration examples
  - Common Coverage Pitfalls and solutions
  - Coverage-Driven Development workflow

#### Best Practices Highlights:
```javascript
// ✅ DO:
- Set realistic goals (80-85%)
- Focus on critical paths (95%+)
- Test error conditions
- Use coverage to find gaps
- Track coverage trends

// ❌ DON'T:
- Write meaningless tests for coverage
- Set 100% coverage goals
- Ignore coverage reports
- Exclude important code
```

## 🎯 Key Patterns Integrated

### 1. Instrumentation Strategy
```javascript
// Babel configuration for React Native Web
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    ['istanbul', {
      exclude: ['**/*.test.js', '**/*.cy.js', '**/node_modules/**']
    }]
  ]
}
```

### 2. Realistic Thresholds
```json
{
  "check-coverage": true,
  "branches": 75,
  "lines": 80,
  "functions": 80,
  "statements": 80
}
```

### 3. Coverage Collection
```javascript
// Automatic collection in tests
describe('E2E Tests', () => {
  after(() => {
    cy.task('coverage').then((coverage) => {
      expect(coverage.lines.pct).to.be.at.least(80)
    })
  })
})
```

### 4. Report Generation
```bash
# HTML report for analysis
npx nyc report --reporter=html
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Text summary for CI
npx nyc report --reporter=text-summary
```

### 5. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
- name: Test with Coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage
- name: Upload to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## ✅ Consistency Achieved

All four documentation files now provide consistent guidance on:
- **Installation**: Unified setup instructions for @cypress/code-coverage
- **Configuration**: Consistent NYC and Cypress configuration
- **Thresholds**: Aligned coverage targets across documentation
- **Instrumentation**: React Native Web specific setup
- **Reporting**: Standard report generation and viewing
- **Best Practices**: Unified recommendations and anti-patterns

## 📊 Coverage Strategy Summary

### Overall Project Goals
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% lines, 75% branches, 80% functions
- **Critical Paths**: 95% coverage for authentication, payments, data models
- **Incremental Improvement**: Track and improve coverage sprint by sprint

### Implementation Phases
1. **Setup Phase**: Install and configure coverage tools
2. **Baseline Phase**: Measure current coverage
3. **Improvement Phase**: Target untested code systematically
4. **Maintenance Phase**: Enforce thresholds in CI/CD

### Expected Benefits
- **Quality Improvement**: Find untested code paths
- **Bug Prevention**: Catch issues in error handling
- **Documentation**: Coverage reports show tested features
- **Confidence**: High coverage for critical paths

---

## 🔄 Migration Checklist

Teams should implement code coverage by:
1. ✅ Install @cypress/code-coverage and babel-plugin-istanbul
2. ✅ Configure cypress.config.js with coverage task
3. ✅ Add Istanbul plugin to babel.config.js
4. ✅ Create .nycrc with realistic thresholds
5. ✅ Add coverage scripts to package.json
6. ✅ Run initial coverage report to establish baseline
7. ✅ Set component-specific coverage targets
8. ✅ Integrate coverage checks in CI/CD pipeline
9. ✅ Add coverage badges to README
10. ✅ Track coverage trends over time
