# Cypress Test Transfer Summary

## Overview
Successfully transferred and adapted Cypress test files from fantasy-element-builder to FantasyWritingApp, converting from worldbuilding domain to writing app domain.

## Transferred Files

### E2E Tests
#### ✅ Characters (adapted from Elements)
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/e2e/elements/`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/characters/`
- **Files**:
  - `character-editor.cy.ts` (adapted from element-editor.cy.ts)
  - `character-full-workflow.cy.ts` (adapted from element-full-workflow.cy.ts)

#### ✅ Navigation
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/e2e/navigation/`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/navigation/`
- **Files**:
  - `navigation.cy.ts` (adapted for stories instead of projects)

#### ✅ Integration Tests
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/e2e/integration/`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/integration/`
- **Files**:
  - `command-verification.cy.ts` (adapted for writing app domain)

#### ✅ Smoke Tests
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/e2e/smoke/`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/smoke/`
- **Files**:
  - `basic-functionality.cy.ts` (adapted for writing app)

#### ✅ Stories (already existed)
- **Existing**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/stories/story-crud.cy.ts`
- **Note**: Similar to projects/project-crud.cy.ts in source

#### ➕ New Scenes Tests
- **Created**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/e2e/scenes/scene-editor.cy.ts`
- **Purpose**: Writing-specific scene management and editing workflows

### Support Files
#### ✅ Test Data
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/support/test-data.ts`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/support/test-data.ts`
- **Adaptations**:
  - Projects → Stories
  - Elements → Characters
  - Added Scene types and interfaces
  - Added writing-specific data structures

#### ✅ Reference Tests
- **Source**: `/fantasy-element-builder/cypress/e2e-stable/`
- **Target**: `/FantasyWritingApp/cypress/reference/`
- **Purpose**: Stable test patterns for reference during development

## Domain Adaptations Made

### Terminology Changes
| Source (Fantasy Builder) | Target (Writing App) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Projects | Stories |
| Elements | Characters |
| Categories (character/location/magic) | Character Types (protagonist/antagonist/supporting) |
| Worldbuilding | Writing |
| BaseElementForm | Character Profile Form |
| Project CRUD | Story CRUD |

### Selector Updates
- `[data-cy="project-*"]` → `[data-cy="story-*"]`
- `[data-cy="element-*"]` → `[data-cy="character-*"]`
- `[data-cy="create-project"]` → `[data-cy="create-story"]`
- `[data-cy="create-element"]` → `[data-cy="create-character"]`

### Route Changes
- `/projects` → `/stories`
- `/project/` → `/story/`
- `/element/` → `/character/`
- Added `/scene/` routes

### Writing-Specific Features Added
- Character development tracking
- Character arc progression
- Character voice and dialogue patterns
- Scene creation and editing
- Scene organization by chapters
- Rich text editing for scene content
- Character assignment to scenes

## Files NOT Transferred

### Component Tests
- **Reason**: Too many (80+ files), domain-specific to fantasy elements
- **Action**: Will create new component tests as needed for writing app components
- **Location**: Available in source for reference if needed

### Complex Support Files
- **Files**: 
  - `mock-store.tsx`
  - `mock-zustand-store.tsx`
  - `component-test-helpers.tsx`
  - `css-helpers.ts`
- **Reason**: Likely need adaptation for writing app's state management
- **Action**: Can be transferred later if needed

### Documentation Files
- **Files**: Various `.md` files with testing strategies and reports
- **Reason**: Specific to fantasy-element-builder project
- **Action**: Will create new documentation as needed

## Adaptations Required for UI Implementation

### Data Structures Needed
1. **Story Interface**: Title, description, genre, status, characters[], scenes[]
2. **Character Interface**: Name, type, profile, relationships[], developmentPercentage
3. **Scene Interface**: Title, content, order, chapterNumber, characters[]
4. **Relationship Interface**: Type, target character, description

### UI Components Needed
1. **Story Management**: Create, edit, list stories
2. **Character Management**: Character profiles, relationships, development tracking
3. **Scene Management**: Scene editor with rich text, chapter organization
4. **Navigation**: Story > Characters/Scenes, breadcrumbs
5. **Character Types**: Protagonist, antagonist, supporting character selection

### Selectors to Implement
All `data-cy` attributes referenced in tests need corresponding UI elements:
- Story CRUD: `story-card`, `create-story`, `story-title`, etc.
- Character CRUD: `character-card`, `create-character`, `character-name`, etc.
- Scene CRUD: `scene-card`, `create-scene`, `scene-editor`, etc.
- Navigation: `nav-characters`, `nav-scenes`, `breadcrumb`, etc.

## Integration with Existing Tests

### Already Exists
- `authentication.cy.ts` - Matches domain adaptation
- `story-crud.cy.ts` - Core story functionality
- Support infrastructure (commands.ts, test-helpers.ts, etc.)

### Conflicts/Updates Needed
- Test helpers may need updates for character/scene creation
- Selectors may need alignment between existing and new tests
- Auth setup should work across all tests

## Next Steps

1. **Implement UI Components**: Create components with corresponding `data-cy` selectors
2. **Update Test Helpers**: Add character and scene creation helpers
3. **Validate Test Coverage**: Run tests as UI is implemented
4. **Add Component Tests**: Create component tests for new writing-specific components
5. **Performance Testing**: Adapt performance tests for large stories with many characters/scenes
