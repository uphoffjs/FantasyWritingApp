## Root Causes

### 1. **Missing UI Implementation**
The application is still in early development. Most UI components and features that the tests expect have not been implemented yet. This is expected as the tests were migrated from another project.

### 2. **Selector Mismatch**
Tests use `data-cy` attributes for element selection, but the current UI doesn't have these attributes added yet.

### 3. **Feature Gaps**
Core features like:
- Authentication UI
- Story management (CRUD)
- Chapter management
- Auto-save
- User roles

Are not yet implemented in the application.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Mark tests as pending** until features are implemented
2. **Focus on implementing core features** before running full test suite
3. **Add data-cy attributes** to existing UI elements

### Development Priority
1. **Authentication UI**: Implement login/logout UI with proper data-cy attributes
2. **Story Creation**: Build basic story creation form
3. **Story List**: Implement story list view
4. **Navigation**: Add proper routing for `/stories` route

### Test Strategy
1. **Start with component tests** for individual features as they're built
2. **Gradually enable E2E tests** as features become available
3. **Use test-driven development** - write tests first, then implement features

## Technical Notes

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ TypeScript configuration conflict resolved by removing `customConditions` from main tsconfig
- ✅ Server port conflict resolved (using port 3002)
- ✅ Cypress now runs successfully in headless mode

### Test Execution Command
```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

### Test Environment
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:3002
- **Browser**: Electron 130 (headless)
- **Cypress Version**: 14.5.4
- **Node Version**: v20.19.3

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement basic UI structure** with proper data-cy attributes
2. **Build authentication flow** to enable auth tests
3. **Create story management features** to enable CRUD tests
4. **Run tests incrementally** as features are completed
5. **Update selectors in tests** if UI structure differs from expectations

---

## Conclusion

The test infrastructure is successfully set up and working. The high failure rate is expected since the application is in early development and doesn't yet have the features the tests are looking for. As development progresses and features are implemented, these tests will start passing.

The tests serve as a specification for what needs to be built and will provide excellent regression testing once the features are implemented.
