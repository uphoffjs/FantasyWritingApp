# Session Management Testing - TODO

**Branch**: feature/cypress-test-coverage
**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

---

## üéØ Primary Objectives

### 1. Debug Auth Flow: Investigate Login Navigation Issue

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
**Priority**: üö® Critical

**Problem**: Login is not navigating to `/projects` after successful authentication

**Investigation Steps**:

- [ ] Review authentication flow in `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`
- [ ] Check navigation logic after successful login
- [ ] Verify React Navigation configuration for `/projects` route
- [ ] Examine auth state management in Zustand store
- [ ] Check for any error handling that might block navigation
- [ ] Review console logs and network requests during login
- [ ] Validate session token storage and retrieval

**Files to Review**:

- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`
- `src/store/authStore.ts`
- `src/navigation/` (navigation config)
- `cypress/e2e/authentication/session-management.cy.ts`

**Expected Behavior**:

- User enters valid credentials
- Authentication succeeds with stub responses
- Navigation automatically redirects to `/projects`
- Session persists correctly

---

### 2. Fix Application Code: Update Auth Handling

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
**Priority**: üö® Critical
**Depends On**: Task 1 (Debug Auth Flow)

**Goal**: Update authentication handling to work seamlessly with Cypress stub responses

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] Identify integration points between auth code and stub responses
- [ ] Update auth flow to handle stubbed API responses correctly
- [ ] Ensure navigation triggers properly with test data
- [ ] Validate token handling works with stub authentication
- [ ] Update error handling if needed for test scenarios
- [ ] Add defensive checks for edge cases
- [ ] Verify compatibility with both real and stubbed backends

**Files to Modify**:

- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` (likely primary)
- `src/store/authStore.ts` (if state management involved)
- `src/services/` (if auth service layer exists)

**Testing Strategy**:

- Manual testing with dev server
- Cypress test validation
- Both stub and real backend verification

### 3. Re-run Tests: Validate Session Management Suite

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
**Priority**: üü° Important
**Depends On**: Task 2 (Fix Application Code)

**Goal**: Ensure all 7 session management tests pass consistently

**Test Execution**:

```bash
# Run session management test suite
SPEC=cypress/e2e/authentication/session-management.cy.ts npm run cypress:docker:test:spec
```

**Test Checklist**:

- [ ] Test 1: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 2: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 3: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 4: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 5: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 6: [Test name from suite]
- [ ] Test 7: [Test name from suite]

**Validation Criteria**:

- ‚úÖ All 7 tests pass
- ‚úÖ No flaky test behavior
- ‚úÖ Consistent results across multiple runs
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings

**If Tests Fail**:

- [ ] Create test failure report (see TEST-RESULTS-MANAGEMENT.md)
- [ ] Document failure patterns
- [ ] Return to Task 2 for additional fixes

### 4. Commit Fixes: Merge to Feature Branch

**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
**Priority**: üü¢ Normal
**Depends On**: Task 3 (All Tests Passing)

**Goal**: Commit authentication fixes and merge back to feature branch

**Git Workflow**:

```bash
# Check current status
git status
git branch

# Stage changes
git add src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx
git add [other modified files]

# Commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve login navigation issue for session management tests

- Fixed navigation flow after successful authentication
- Updated auth handling to work with Cypress stub responses
- Ensured proper redirect to /projects after login
- All 7 session management tests now passing

Resolves authentication flow blocking session management test suite."

# Verify feature branch
git checkout feature/cypress-test-coverage

# Merge changes (if on separate branch)
git merge --no-ff [working-branch]

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/cypress-test-coverage
```

**Pre-Commit Checklist**:

- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (max 0 warnings)
- [ ] All session management tests pass
- [ ] No unintended file changes
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions
- [ ] Pre-commit hook passes (protected files, lint, critical test)

## üìã Session Notes

### Background

- Session management test suite exists with 7 tests
- Current issue: Login authentication not navigating to `/projects`
- Tests likely using Cypress stub responses for auth
- Need to fix application code to work with test stubs

### Key Files

- **Test Suite**: `cypress/e2e/authentication/session-management.cy.ts`
- **Login Screen**: `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`
- **Auth Store**: `src/store/authStore.ts`
- **Navigation**: React Navigation configuration

### Success Criteria

- Login completes successfully with stub responses
- Navigation redirects to `/projects` automatically
- All 7 session management tests pass consistently
- Changes committed to feature branch

## üîÑ Progress Tracking

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16
**Overall Progress**: 0/4 tasks completed (0%)

**Next Steps**:

1. Start with Task 1: Debug authentication flow
2. Use Chrome DevTools and Cypress logs for investigation
3. Review test suite to understand expected behavior
4. Document findings before implementing fixes
