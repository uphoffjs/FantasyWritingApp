## Implementation Priority Order

### Week 1: Infrastructure (Phase 1)
1. Fix all module import issues (1.1)
2. Create React Native Web compatibility layer (1.2)
3. Fix BaseElementForm core issues (1.3)
**Expected Result**: ~60% pass rate

### Week 2: Interactions (Phase 2)
1. Fix input event handling (2.1)
2. Fix component state management (2.2)
3. Improve selector strategies (2.3)
**Expected Result**: ~75% pass rate

### Week 3: Stability (Phase 3)
1. Optimize test environment (3.1)
2. Fix component-specific issues (3.2)
3. Implement proper factories (3.3)
**Expected Result**: ~90% pass rate

### Week 4: Polish (Phase 4 & 5)
1. Handle edge cases (4.1)
2. Fix accessibility tests (4.2)
3. Optimize performance (4.3)
4. Complete documentation (5.1-5.3)
**Expected Result**: 100% pass rate

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1 Success**: No module import errors, categories expand properly
- **Phase 2 Success**: All input interactions work, onChange fires correctly
- **Phase 3 Success**: No flaky tests, consistent results across runs
- **Phase 4 Success**: All edge cases pass, accessibility complete
- **Phase 5 Success**: Full documentation, CI/CD integrated

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **React Native Web Compatibility**: May require significant refactoring
   - Mitigation: Create abstraction layer for web-specific behavior
   
2. **Event Handling**: Complex due to synthetic event differences
   - Mitigation: Create custom event handlers for tests
   
3. **Async State Updates**: Timing issues in tests
   - Mitigation: Implement proper wait utilities

### Fallback Strategies
- If React Native Web issues persist: Consider web-specific test components
- If event handling remains problematic: Use alternative testing strategies
- If 100% is unachievable: Focus on critical path coverage (min 95%)

## Notes

- Current working components (AutoSaveIndicator, Button, TextInput) can serve as reference implementations
- Focus on systematic fixes rather than individual test patches
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing passing tests
- Regular progress tracking and adjustment of timeline as needed
